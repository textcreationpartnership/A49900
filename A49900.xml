            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Advertiſement.</head>
            <p>'TIS thought that the following <hi>Lives</hi> will not be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nacceptable to the Publick. The Author of 'em, who is well known by his Writings, juſtly complains, that thoſe who have hitherto written the Lives of the Fathers, have not done it with ſuch an Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality as is required from thoſe who write for the ſake of Truth. Indeed, it muſt be confeſt that <hi>Panegyricks</hi> of all ſorts are very Numerous, and that a True and Faithful Account of the Lives and Doctrine of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:57945:3"/>is very Neceſſary. This Author will have it, that he hath diſtinguiſhed himſelf from other Writers in his Lives of <hi>ſome</hi> Fathers, and profeſſes a great Sincerity. This, I think, is more than ſufficient to recommend the Reading of this Work.</p>
            <p>But beſides, it contains ſeveral Judicious Obſervations, and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Remarks upon the Lives and Opinion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Fathers, very uſeful, eſpecially to thoſe who apply or deſign to apply themſelves to that Study. I think that the Fathers were far from being Infallible, but I am none of thoſe who deſpiſe the Study of their Writings. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, it doth not require a Dull
<pb facs="tcp:57945:3"/>and Narrow-Spirited Reader, who may grow the worſe for it: But an Ingenious and Judicious one may make a good uſe of it, as will appear by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lives,</hi> which may alſo give ſome Light to the late Diſputes concerning the Holy <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall further add, That the Fathers, whoſe Lives Monſieur <hi>Le Clerc</hi> hath written, are ſome of the most Famous. Every body knows that <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> were very Learned Men; and that <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> was one of the greatest Orators the Chriſtians had in his time. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> having been much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb facs="tcp:57945:4"/>in the <hi>Arian</hi> Diſputes, it was neceſſary to give a large Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe Controverſies, which makes the Life of that Father ſo much the more Curious and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful. In ſhort, the Reader will find here the Lives of ſome of the most Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Fathers who lived in the most famous Ages of Chriſtianity, written with great Exactneſs and Impartiality; and they are, I think, ſufficient to give a Notion of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>I must not forget that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Le Clerc</hi> hath taken care to ſhew what Philoſophy thoſe Fathers did eſpecially apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to. This is a very Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Enquiry; and thoſe that are not ſenſible of its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:57945:4"/>will be eaſily convinced of it, when they come to read the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowinging <hi>Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas alſo thought fit to print the <hi>Hiſtory of Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> tho' very ſhort, together with theſe <hi>Lives;</hi> becauſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gentlemen may be deſirous to have in their own Tongue an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Account of that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, which formerly made ſo great a Noiſe in the Chriſtian World.</p>

               <hi>The Life</hi> OF Clemens Alexandrinus.</head>
            <p>ALthough thoſe that are able to read the <hi>Fathers</hi> in the Original Tongues, are but few; yet there are a great many who ought to have ſome Notions of their Lives and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, becauſe they are now-a-days made uſe of in the Controverſies which divide Chriſtians. The Teachers of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> omit nothing to make Men believe, that the Fathers were of their Opinion; becauſe they believe, that it is not lawful to reject a Doctrine grounded upon the Teſtimony of the greateſt part of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. When they quote a Paſſage, which they think to be agreeable to their Notions, they don't fail to ſay, <hi>As a Holy Father ſaid well.</hi> But if One objects to them ſome
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57945:6"/>words which they cannot well get rid of: They anſwer, That 'twas only his private Opinion; and reject it as an Error.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do not lay down the Conſent of the Fathers, as a Principle of their Faith; but as for the reſt, many of their Authors ſeldom make any other uſe of them, when they cite 'em, than the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>

            <p>Hence it is, that in the Eccleſiaſtical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of both Parties, ſuch Places as ſeem proper to confirm the Opinion and Practices received now-a-days amongſt us, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved: Whereas ſuch things as are thought to be Defective in their Conduct and Doctrine, are only mentioned by the bye. They perſuade themſelves that the Fathers, eſpecially thoſe of the Firſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, held all the Opinions, which are lookt upon as Eſſential where they live; and then they think themſelves obliged to heap up Praiſes upon 'em; and excuſe, as much as they can, the Defects which are obſerved either in their Writings or Lives: So that inſtead of writing their Hiſtory, they write, without being aware of it, their <hi>Panegyrick</hi> or Apology. Hence it is, that they who read ſuch Books, believe that the Antients were Men of vaſt Learning, and extraordinary Holineſs. From whence they conclude, that if they have ill treated
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57945:6"/>any Body, they muſt needs have had ſome great Reaſons for it; and that they were far either from unfaithfully relating, or ill confuting the Opinions of Hereticks. They think themſelves obliged to imitate their manner of Reaſoning and Acting, without much troubling themſelves whether it be agreeable to the Precepts of the Goſpel, or not. Thus it comes to paſs, that we have no Hiſtories of the Firſt Centuries, that are faithful enough; and do not make ſuch a Uſe of thoſe Hiſtories as we ought to make.</p>
            <p>I am far from thinking that I can cure ſo inveterate a Diſeaſe, nor is it the Deſign of this Work: But at leaſt, I think my ſelf obliged to avoid, as much as I can, the Way of thoſe, who give the Publick Partial Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks, when Sincere and Impartial Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories were expected from them. I have endeavoured to practice this in <hi>The Hiſtory of Pelagianiſm,;</hi> and I ſhall yet endeavour to do it in the <hi>Life of Clemens,</hi> which I am going to write in few words.</p>

               <hi>TIT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S FLAVI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CLEMENS,</hi> famous for his Learing towards the End of the Second Century, was born at <hi>Athens,</hi> according to ſome Authors, who believe they can reconcile this Opinion with the Opinion of thoſe who call him
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57945:7"/>
               <hi>Alexandrinus,</hi> by ſaying that <hi>Athens</hi> was the Place of his Birth; and that he got the Sirname of <hi>Alexandrinus,</hi> becauſe of his long ſtay at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> But his Style, though florid enough, is often obſcure and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and doth not much reliſh the Neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Elegancy of the Athenian Writers. However, it is certain that he begun his Studies in <hi>Greece,</hi> continued them in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ended his days in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears, that he was not content to be inſtructed only by one Maſter, but that he travelled much to hear many, and ſo to get a more exact and full knowledge of the Chriſtian Religion, as well as to improve in Humane Learning. His Maſters had been Diſciples of the Apoſtles, or had converſed with ſome Diſciples of thoſe Holy Men, as it appears by his manner of ſpeaking of them, though he doth not expreſs himſelf very clearly.</p>

                  <hi>Aſſyrian;</hi> and the other, with whom I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> was of a Jewiſh Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction: This latter was the firſt in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. I ſtay'd in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he had hid himſelf, to look for him. He was, as the Proverb ſays, <hi>A true Sicilian Bee.</hi> He gathered the Flowers ſcattered (if one may ſo ſay) in the Meadows of the Writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, by the means whereof he filled the Souls of thoſe that heard him with a pure Knowledge. Thoſe Men having preſerved the true Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Bleſſed Doctrine, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Holy Apoſtles, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as a Child who keeps what he hath learned of his Father <hi>(Although there are Few like them)</hi> have lived to our time, by the Will of God, to ſhed into our Hearts the Seed which they had received of the Apoſtles their Predeceſſors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis of great moment to know what Maſter an Author had, to underſtand his Opinions right; for then, as now-a-days, the Diſciples did particularly ſtick to the Method of their Maſters; and explained Religion, as much as they could, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Principles of that Philoſophy which they had learned of them. Thus the School-men, who were <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> explained Divinity by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57945:8"/>and Divinity is handled after the <hi>Carteſian</hi> way, where <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> Philoſophy is admitted.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Learned Men of our Age have endeavoured to gueſs, who were thoſe of whom <hi>Clemens</hi> ſpeaks. It appears, by my Tranſlation of the words of that Father, that he had five Maſters; but <hi>Valeſius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows him but four, becauſe he follows the Reading of <hi>Euſebius.</hi> One can't poſitively affirm which is the beſt; but I may ſay, that the Interpreters who took the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> for a Proper Name, have done it without reaſon. 'Tis not likely that <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> who doth not tell the Names of the other, whom he acknowledges for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſhould name this. Antiquity affords no Man whoſe Name was <hi>Ionick,</hi> and that Name may denote the Sect of Philoſophy to which that firſt Maſter of <hi>Clemens</hi> did eſpecially apply himſelf. <hi>Thales</hi> and <hi>Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi> Philoſophers of <hi>Miletus,</hi> a Town of <hi>Ionia,</hi> were the Heads of it.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Elſewhere he ſays, <hi>That</hi> Thales<note n="*" place="margin">Strom. l. <hi>5.</hi> p. <hi>595.</hi>

               <hi>being askt what God is? He anſwered, That which hath neither a Beginning nor an End. And that another having askt him, whether Men can hide their Actions from God? How can that be, anſwered he, ſince they cannot ſo much as hide their Thoughts from him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Speaking of <hi>Anaximander, Archelaus,</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> Philoſophers of the ſame Sect, he ſays, That the former hath eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht<note n="†" place="margin">Admen. ad Gent. p. <hi>43.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>the Infinite</hi> for the Firſt Being; and that the other two ſaid that <hi>the Spirit</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Infinite.</p>
            <p>The Principles of thoſe Philoſophers may be ſeen more at large in <hi>Diogenes Laertius:</hi> and one may eaſily perceive, that ſome of them do well enough agree with thoſe of the Jews and Chriſtians; as, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is upon the Earth came out of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; That the Night was before the Day; That moſt Men are Wicked; That to live Juſtly, we muſt not do what we blame in others; That Heaven is our true Native Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis not therefore incredible,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57945:9"/>that a Philoſopher of that Sect ſhould have embraced Chriſtianity, and been the firſt Maſter of <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that can be ſaid againſt it, is, that the Succeſſion of the Philoſophers of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Sect ended in <hi>Archelaus,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Socrates.</hi> But although there were no Maſters of that Philoſophy, who did immediately ſucceed one another; yet it doth not follow but there might be ſome Philoſophers, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, who followed the Opinions of <hi>Thales,</hi> and his firſt Diſciples. Thus <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes Laertius</hi> ſays, in his <hi>Preface,</hi> that the <hi>Italick</hi> Sect, of which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was the Head, ended in <hi>Epicurus;</hi> although there hath been ſome <hi>Pythagoraean</hi> Philoſophers many Ages after <hi>Epicurus.</hi> No Body ought to wonder that we ſhould ſay, that a Chriſtian follow'd a certain Sect of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, becauſe it is only to be underſtood inaſmuch as he thought it agreeable to Chriſtianity. Thus <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> was a <hi>Platonick;</hi> and <hi>Pantaenus, Clemens</hi>'s Maſter,<note n="*" place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Name of the ſecond, whom he ſaw in <hi>Great Greece,</hi> or <hi>Calabria,</hi> is altogether unknown. Some<note n="†" place="margin">Valeſ. ad Euſeb.</note> believe that the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> was <hi>Tatianus,</hi> a Philoſopher and Diſciple of <hi>Juſtin Martyr;</hi> and others,<note n="‖" place="margin">Baron. ad Ann. <hi>185.</hi>

               <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſanes</hi> of <hi>Edeſſus</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> who had been
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57945:9"/>a <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and never wholly laid aſide the Opinions of that Sect.</p>
            <p>As for him who was of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Origin, ſome believe he might be <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> although Hiſtory doth not ſay that he deſcended from Jewiſh Parents. Wherefore, others conjecture that he was one <hi>Theodotus,</hi> whoſe Doctrine <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> had expounded in his <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>typoles,</hi> or <hi>Inſtitutions of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> from whence it is that the Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Work, which is to be found at the end of <hi>Clemen</hi>'s Works, is intituled <hi>Extracts of the Eaſtern Doctrine of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus.</hi> But ſome aſcribe thoſe Extracts to <hi>Theodotus Byzantinus,</hi> a Currier by Trade, but a learned Man, who was Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> in the Year CXCIV. becauſe he taught, that Chriſt was but a meer Man.</p>
            <p>Laſtly: The laſt of <hi>Clemens</hi>'s Maſters, whom he prefers before all the other, and to whom he applied himſelf, was <hi>Pantaenus. Euſebius</hi> is of opinion, that <hi>Clemens</hi> means Him, in the latter part of that Paſſage which I have citedout of him. Indeed, <hi>Pantaenus</hi> taught in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when <hi>Clemens</hi> ſettled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there; and this latter called him his Maſter<note n="*" place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note> in his <hi>Hypotypoſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pantaenus</hi>'s Native Countrey and Parents are not known; but 'tis certain that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57945:10"/>himſelf much to the Study of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, eſpecially that of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps being moved with the ſevere Manners and Maxims of the Philoſophers, which did well enough agree with thoſe of the Ancient Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>There had been<note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> in the <hi>Extracts of the Eaſtern Doctrine of Theodotus,</hi> wherein <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> ſpeaks thus: <hi>Our</hi> Pantaenus, <hi>ſays, that the Prophets do commonly expreſs themſelves by the Aorist, and uſe the Preſent Tenſe inſtead of the Future and Preterit Tenſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis likely that <hi>Pantaenus</hi> was a <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chist,</hi> when <hi>Clemens</hi> came to <hi>Egypt;</hi> and that he ſtudied ſome time under him, before he ſucceeded him.

            <p>
               <hi>Clemens</hi> would not ſtick wholly to any Sect, leſt he ſhould take for Philoſophers ſuch as perhaps had only the Out-ſide of 'em, but followed that manner of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſing which was then call'd <hi>Eclectick,</hi> that is to ſay, the Method of thoſe, who choſe, out of all the Opinions of the Philoſophers, thoſe which ſeem'd the moſt rational to them, and made a Syſtem of them for their Private Uſe.<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57945:11"/>agreeably to the Light of Nature, or ſome ancient Traditions current almoſt through the whole World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clemens</hi> himſelf teaches us thus much; and aſſures us, that he applied himſelf to the <hi>Eclectick</hi> Philoſophy, for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that I have alledged.

            <p>Afterwards he ſays, That no Body could do it, but by a Divine Revelation; but that if it ſhould happen, as it were by chance, that any one did it without that help, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be more certain than that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy: and although he could not defend himſelf by the Authority of Revelation, Truth would maintain it ſelf only by its own Light.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he blames thoſe who ſtick to One Sect, ſo as to embrace all its Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and condemn all other Sects, being ready to diſpute againſt all the Doctrines which they have not learned of their Maſters. That Deſign, of collecting whatever the Philoſophers ſaid that was agreeable to the Goſpel, is undoubtedly a fine one, and may very much conduce to convince Men of the Truth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion. But to do it ſuccesfully, 'tis neceſſary to underſtand both Philoſophy and the Chriſtian Religion well, and to confine one's ſelf to clear and undeniable Articles, ſuch as thoſe that are <hi>Practical,</hi> and ſome few <hi>Speculative</hi> ones. The Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox of that time had introduced into the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57945:12"/>Chriſtian Religion, for want of Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an infinite number of Philoſophical Doctrines, which have no relation with thoſe of the Goſpel.</p>

They fell into this Conceit, becauſe <hi>Plato</hi> would have Women to be Common in his Commonwealth; and becauſe they had wreſted ſeveral Places of the Scripture, to make them agree with that Opinion. But <hi>Clemens</hi> is of opinion, that they underſtood neither the Scripture nor <hi>Plato</hi> well. This latter meant only this, he thinks, That there ſhould be no Maid in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but to whom All the Citizens might indifferently pretend; although if ſhe had been Betrothed to any Man, others could no more hope to Marry her.

Becauſe the Scripture often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57945:12"/>the Miſeries of this World, and praiſes Continency, they fancied that the Sacred Writers had the ſame Notions of this Life and Generation, or Birth, that <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> had. Thoſe Philoſophers believed, that the Souls did exiſt before the Bodies, into which they are ſent only to be puniſht for the Sins which they had committed in another Life: So that, to ſpeak properly, Birth ſhould be called <hi>Death,</hi> rather than a Beginning of Life; and Death <hi>Life,</hi> becauſe when we are born, our Souls are thrown into the Priſon of the Body, out of which they are ſet at liberty when we die. Hence it is that thoſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and many Poets after 'em, ſaid, That 'twas better not to be born, than to come into the World; and to die in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, than to live many Years. Hence it is alſo, that ſome times they ſpeak vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently enough againſt the Uſe of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; becauſe, in their opinion, it did only conduce to build a Priſon for ſome Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Soul, which was thrown into the Body that was produced.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Valentinians</hi> had alſo learned what they ſaid concerning the Generation of their <hi>Aeones,</hi> of <hi>Heſiod,</hi> as it will appear by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Beginning of his <hi>Theogonia</hi> with the Doctrine of the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> as it is reported by St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>

They ſacrifice to Men, what they ſhould eat; and offering
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57945:15"/>Dead Things to the Dead, as to Gods. they prove Ungrateful to the True God, and ſo deny his Exiſtence. <hi>And that it may appear that We and the Greeks Know the True God, though in a different manner, he goes on thus;</hi> Worſhip not God neither as the Jews; for fancying that They only know God, they do not perceive that they worſhip Angels and Archangels, the Months, and the Moons; for if the Moon does not appear, they do not obſerve the Sabbath which they call <hi>First,</hi> nor the New Moon, nor the Days of Unleavened Bread, nor any Holy Day. <hi>Laſtly, he concludes, ſaying;</hi> As for you, Learn the Juſt and Holy Doctrine which we teach you; obſerve it, and worſhip God after a new manner, through Jeſus Chriſt. For we read in the Scripture, that God ſaid, I make a new Covenant with you, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that which I made with your Fathers upon Mount <hi>Horeb.</hi> He hath given us a New Covenant; for both that of the Jews and Greeks is old; and We, who worſhip him after a Third and New manner, are Chriſtians. <hi>He clearly ſhews</hi> (as <hi>Clemens</hi> adds) <hi>That one and the ſame God was known to the Greeks, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Heathens; to the Jews, after the Jewiſh manner; and to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, after a New and Spiritual manner. He ſhews further,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57945:15"/>That the ſame God who gave the Two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, is He who gave Philoſophy to the Greeks, by which the Almighty is glorified amongſt 'em,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As God was pleaſed to ſave the Jews, by giving them ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; ſo he hath raiſed among the Greeks the most Honeſt Men, whom he hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht from the Vulgar, according as they were capable of receiving his Benefits, to perform the part of</hi> PROPHETS <hi>amongſt 'em in their own Tongue.

            <p>As to the Miniſtry of Angels, to reveal Philoſophy to the Greeks, <hi>Clemens,</hi> and thoſe who have been of the ſame Opinion, came by it partly by reaſon of what <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid concerning his <hi>Daemon,</hi> who warned him of ſeveral things, and of whom<note n="‖" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 311, <hi>&amp;</hi> 334.</note>

            <p>I could alledge many other Inſtances, whereby it would appear, that <hi>Clemens</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the Opinions of the Chriſtians, by the like Doctrines which he found in the Philoſophers.

            <p>One may further learn one thing from thence, which moſt of thoſe who apply themſelves to the reading of the Fathers, do not much mind; and without which, 'tis almoſt impoſſible to underſtand them well, in an infinite number of places: <hi>viz.</hi> That before One begins ſeriouſly that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57945:21"/>Study, the Heathen Philoſophers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Plato,</hi> muſt be carefully read. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, One can't well apprehend what Grounds they go upon, nor ſuccesful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine the ſtrength of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, nor gueſs how they came by ſo many Opinions that are ſo different from thoſe which are now entertained in our Schools.</p>
            <p>Now to return to the Life of <hi>Clemens:</hi> The Antients do unanimouſly ſay that he ſucceeded <hi>Pantaenus</hi> in the Office of <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chist.</hi> He performed it with ſucceſs; and many Great Men came out of his School, as <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Method of Inſtructing the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumeni,</hi> conſiſted in teaching them what was Good in the Heathen Philoſophy, and ſo leading them by degrees to Chriſtianity; which they more readily embraced, when they had reliſhed many of thoſe Maxims derived from the Light of Nature, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in the Writing of the Philoſophers, whom they ſaw every Body had a great Reſpect for, than if they had been roughly told, that they ought to renounce all their Opinions, and look upon the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, not only as Men that were guilty of Error, but that had ſaid nothing that was

            </p>
            <p>In effect, the Light of the Goſpel ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that of Nature, and doth not deſtroy it. We don't find that Chriſt and his Apoſtles undertook to give us a compleat Syſtem of all the Doctrines that have ſome relation with Religion; they ſuppoſed that we were already provided with ſeveral Thoughts received in all Nations, upon which they reaſoned: elſe they ſhould have, for Example, exactly defined all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which they have not done, becauſe they found in the Minds of all Men ſome <hi>Idea</hi>'s, which, though imperfect, yet were moſt true.

            <p>A little while after the Apoſtles, ſome had been ſeen to look for Martyrdom: but ſome having challenged the Executioners, and having ſcandalouſly faln ſhort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, at the ſight of the Torments, that Conduct<note n="†" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.

            <p>As we ought not to avoid Martyrdom, when it cannot be done without renouncing Chriſtianity, or a Good Conſcience; ſo we ought to preſerve our Lives as long as we can, whilſt 'tis likely that we do Chriſtians
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57945:23"/>greater ſervice, by prolonging it if we fly, than by loſing it for the ſake of Truth, by ſtaying in thoſe Places where the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rages, and which we may come out of, without ceaſing to profeſs the Truth.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who blame, or make ſome difficulty to juſtifie ſome <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Miniſters, who came out of a Kingdom, wherein they could not ſtay without imminent Danger, if they continued to perform their Functions; ſhould before prove, that ſuch a Conduct would have been more advantagious to Chriſtianity, than their Retreat. Methinks the Solution of that Queſtion, which hath been lately moved, viz. <hi>Whether they did well to retire?</hi> depends upon this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clemens</hi> ſeems about that time to have left <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſince we read that he made ſome ſtay at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with <hi>Alexander,</hi> who a little while after was Biſhop of that City, and to whom he dedicated his Book entituled, <hi>The Eccleſiaſtical Rule against thoſe who follow the Opinions of the Jews.</hi> Whilſt he ſtaid there, he was very uſeful to that Church, as it appears by a Letter of <hi>Alexander</hi> to the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> of which <hi>Clemens</hi> was the Bearer,<note n="*" place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>6.</hi> p. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note> wherein that Biſhop ſays, <q rend="margQuotes">That he was a Man of great Vertue, as the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> knew, and would know it again; and that being at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by an Effect of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57945:23"/>God's Providence, he had confirm'd and encreaſed the Church of God there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Antioch, Clemens</hi> returned to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> where 'tis not known how long he lived.

            </p>
            <p>Amongſt the many Works which <hi>Clemens</hi> wrote, there are but Three extant that are conſiderable. The Firſt is, <hi>An Exhortation to the Heathens:</hi> Wherein he confutes their Religion, and endeavours to perſuade them to embrace Chriſtianity. The Second is entitled <hi>Paedagogus:</hi> In which he directs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57945:24"/>the Manners of Young Men, and gives them ſome Rules to live like Chriſtians; wherein he mixes ſome Maxims extremely ſevere, and very remote from our Cuſtoms. The Third is, his <hi>Stromata,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Hangings;</hi> which he entitled ſo,<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 276. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 476. <hi>&amp; l.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 766.</note> becauſe of the Variety of Matters which he handles in it.</p>
            <p>He ſhews what Conformity there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſeveral Opinions of the Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and thoſe of the Jews and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: He Cenſures what was Bad, as he thinks, in the Heathen Philoſophy; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends and Explains the Chriſtian Religion; Refutes the Hereticks; and ſhews every where a great Erudition. But he obſerves little or no Order, as he himſelf ſays at the End of the Seventh Book. He takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from one thing to paſs to another, without framing any Plan of what he is to ſay, and without having any other Deſign but to collect the moſt uſeful things he had learned by Study and Meditation.</p>
            <p>His Style in this latter Work, is more harſh than in the two foregoing ones, wherein, notwithſtanding, there is more Affectation, than Elegancy and Neatneſs. He pretends that he had ſome Reaſon for it: But there are Two great Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences in ſuch a Method. The Firſt is, That for want of Order, not only the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57945:24"/>ſtrength of the moſt ſolid Proofs is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but alſo an Author confounds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, often repeats the ſame thing, and heaps up an infinite number of Arguments which prove nothing. The Second is, That a Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of Style, often makes what one ſays unintelligible; for 'tis not only Elegancy, but Clearneſs, that is wanting in it.</p>
            <p>Now, an Affected Obſcurity in Difficult Matters, as thoſe are which <hi>Clemens</hi> treats of, is ſo much the more to blame; becauſe 'tis no eaſie thing to be underſtood, even in Matters that are clear of themſelves, if One does not expreſs himſelf neatly. As we are to ſpeak, only to be underſtood; ſo there is nothing can excuſe an Author for not ſpeaking clearly, but an abſolute impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of expreſſing himſelf better. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are apt to believe, that thoſe who have an Obſcure Style, have no clear Head; and that they ſpeak ſo, becauſe they do not apprehend things more clearly than they ſpeak 'em.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that the affected Ornaments of a far-fetch't Eloquence ought to be deſpiſed; but Clearneſs cannot be reckon'd among thoſe Ornaments.</p>
            <p>It muſt needs be confeſt, that there are but few Fathers, whoſe Writings are not lyable to the ſame Obſervation with thoſe of <hi>Clemens.</hi> Moſt of 'em, whilſt they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57945:25"/>themſelves for not being Eloquent, do whatever they can to appear ſo after their way, as may be ſeen by a thouſand high ſtroaks, and ſtrained Metaphorical Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which their Writings are full of; and we ſee but few, who thought that the greateſt care a Writer ſhould take, conſiſts in exciting in the Minds of his Reader clear Idea's of what he ſays, by uſing Words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Equivocation.</p>
            <p>There is extant beſides, an <hi>Homily</hi> of <hi>Clemens,</hi> entitled, <hi>What Rich Man is Saved?</hi> It was printed in Greek and Latin, by <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>befis,</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> 1672; and at <hi>Oxford,</hi> 1683: With ſeveral other Greek and Latin Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thoſe who took care of the German Edition (at <hi>Colen,</hi> 1688.) of <hi>Clemens</hi>'s Works, ſhould have printed it with the reſt of his Works; it would have made their Edition more conſiderable, which otherwiſe is not much more valuable, as thoſe that uſe it will find. They have only followed the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition, 1641, without adding any thing to it, except New Faults.</p>
            <p>There is, at the End of the Volume, <hi>An Abridgment of the Doctrine of Theodotus, and of the Doctrine called Eaſtern in Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus's time.</hi> The greateſt part of it is only an Interpretation of ſome Places of the Holy Scripture, which ſome think to have been taken out of the Eighth Book of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57945:25"/>

               <hi>Photius,</hi> who had ſeen that Work, ſays alſo, that the Deſign of it was, to Explain the Holy Scripture; but he accuſes the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of maintaining, That Matter is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; That the different Forms which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, are imparted to it by virtue of I know not what Decrees; That the Son is in the number of Things Created; That there hath been Many Worlds before <hi>Adam;</hi> That <hi>Eve</hi> was formed out of him, after another manner than what the Scripture relates; That the Angels having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with ſome Women, had Children by them; That the <hi>Reaſon</hi> was not made Fleſh, tho' it ſeem'd ſo to Men; That there are <hi>Two Reaſons</hi> of the Father, the leaſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of appeared to Men, and was made Fleſh.</p>
            <p>If we had thoſe Books ſtill, we might perhaps more clearly know that they are only ſome <hi>Platonick</hi> Doctrines, ſome of which <hi>Photius</hi> did not well underſtand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57945:26"/>of the Equivocation of the Terms; and the other were not in <hi>Clemens</hi>'s time lookt upon as Impieties, as they have been ſince Syſtems of Divinity were compiled among Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Ages, when no <hi>Syſtems</hi> were entertained in the Schools, and explained to the Youth, as they are now, every one Philoſophized, as well as he could, upon Matters of Speculation; and explained Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Doctrines according to the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy he had learned: Except ſome Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which either becauſe they had made a great Noiſe, or for ſome other Reaſons were condemned by the Biſhops, they were very free in their Thoughts. If any one doubted of it, he might convince himſelf of the Truth thereof, by the ſtrange Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which have been entertained by ſome of the Fathers, who were rank't among the Orthodox, and for which they were not cenſured in their time. One may ſee many Examples of it in the Fourth Chapter of <hi>Dallaeus</hi>'s Book <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu Patrum;</hi> which, notwithſtanding the Panegyriſts of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, will always be accounted a Good Book by thoſe that know Antiquity. Such was, for Example, St. <hi>Hilary</hi>'s Opinion, who believed that Chriſt felt no Pain when he was ſcourged.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Photius</hi> ſuſpects that the Hereticks
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57945:26"/>corrupted the Works of <hi>Clemens;</hi> and <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus</hi> had the ſame Thoughts, as it appears by his Apology for <hi>Origen,</hi> which is in the IV. Tome of St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Works. Yet if there was no more in them, than what <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> cites, there would be no reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they were much corrupted, though it cannot be abſolutely denied. The reaſon of it is, that whatever that learned Patriarch may ſay, thoſe very Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, if well underſtood, are to be found in the other Works of <hi>Clemens,</hi> and are agreeable to the Principles which he follows every where.</p>

               </note> clearly enough the Opinion of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> who believed that the Matter of the World is Eternal; and he ſhews that he eſteems him, for having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht the Matter of the World from its Form; the firſt whereof is immutable, and the ſecond ſubject to change.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Reaſons why Matter receives certain Forms, <hi>Photius</hi> knew no more of it than <hi>Clemens.</hi>

               </note> ſays, in more than one place, that he thought the ſame thing; and moſt of the Ancient Greek and Latin Fathers have explained ſo the Beginning of the Sixth Chapter of <hi>Geneſis. Photius</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not blame that Opinion, without cenſuring, at the ſame time, all Antiquity; but 'tis his Cuſtom to treat ill the moſt Ancient Authors, when he finds in them ſome Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that were not received in his time, or ſome Expreſſions which he doth not think energick enough to expreſs ſuch Thoughts as, in his judgment the Antients ſhould have had; becauſe 'twould have been an Hereſie, not to think ſo, in his time.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>Incarnation</hi> being a Myſtery which we do not comprehend, and <hi>Clemens</hi>'s Style not being, for the moſt part, very clear, he might have expreſt himſelf ſo as not to be well underſtood by <hi>Photius;</hi> which is ſo much the more eaſie to believe, becauſe that Patriarch commonly explains the Thoughts of the Antients agreeably to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57945:28"/>Opinions and Ways of Speaking of his time.</p>
            <p>The Writings of the Antients are full of Equivocal Terms, which they uſe in ſuch a ſence, as they had no more in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages. Terms which ſignifying Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Obſcure Things, and very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Idea's, muſt neceſſarily be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to underſtand; becauſe they took no care to Define them, and make an exact Enumeration of the Idea's which they fixed to them. Perhaps it did not ſo much as come into their Mind, that this was very neceſſary to be well underſtood. At leaſt One may obſerve, that when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to explain themſelves about thoſe Obſcure Matters, they uſe Terms as Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure as the fore-going.</p>
            <p n="8">8. One may obſerve an Example of it, concerning the <hi>Two Reaſons</hi> mention'd by <hi>Photius.</hi> Thoſe who will carefully read the Second Tome of <hi>Origen</hi> upon St. <hi>John,</hi> may obſerve, that he eſtabliſhes a <hi>First</hi> or <hi>Supreme Reaſon,</hi> which is Chriſt's Divinity; and many <hi>Inferior Reaſons,</hi> which are made according to the Image of the Precedent. It might be ſaid, in that ſence, that None but the <hi>Second Reaſons</hi> became Fleſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none but they animate Humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; for although the Firſt was united to the Humane Nature of Chriſt, it did not ſupply the Place of a Soul.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:57945:28"/>
            <p>So that although <hi>Clemens</hi> had ſaid what <hi>Photius</hi> pretends, yet he could not be charged with Hereſie upon that account: But he did not ſay ſo, as appears by the Paſſage which <hi>Photius</hi> himſelf quotes out of him: <hi>The Son is called Reaſon, as well as the Paternal Reaſon; but 'tis not that which was made Fleſh: Nor is it the Paternal Reaſon neither, but a Divine Power (which is, as it were, an Emanation of that ſame Reaſon)</hi> which became Spirit (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) <hi>and is come into the Hearts of Men.</hi> By thoſe Terms, <hi>The Son,</hi> we muſt not underſtand <hi>the Only Begotten Son of God,</hi> but <hi>the Man;</hi> as it clearly appears by what follows. <hi>Clemens,</hi> perhaps, call'd him only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; becauſe he might have before clearly enough denoted whom he meant by that word. <hi>Photius,</hi> who did not well apprehend the Meaning of that Paſſage, might eaſily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the Series of that Diſcourſe: As the Jeſuite <hi>Schottus,</hi> otherwiſe a Learned Man, was altogether miſtaken in the Latin Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of thoſe Words, as one may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently obſerve, by comparing it with mine.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We have a Latin Work<note n="*" place="margin">In Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliot. Pat.</note> aſcribed to <hi>Clemens,</hi> and intituled, <hi>Commentariola in Primam Canonicam S. Petri, in Epiſtolam Judae, &amp; Tres Epiſtolas S. Joannis Apoſtoli.</hi> There is indeed ſeveral things in thoſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57945:29"/>Notes, which do not differ from <hi>Clemens</hi>'s Doctrine; but we can't know whether they are an entire Tranſlation of part of the <hi>Hypotypoles,</hi> or only ſome Extracts cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected according to the Interpreter's mind.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known, that when the Latins tranſlated ſome Greek Writings, they were very apt to make ſuch Alterations in them as they thought fit, (as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> hath been upbraided with it.) Nay, there is no need to look ſo far for Examples of that ill Cuſtom, ſince we have one with relation to part of <hi>Clemens</hi>'s <hi>Hypotypoſes,</hi> of which <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiodorus</hi> ſpeaks thus: <q>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clemens</hi> alſo compoſed Five Tracts, which are loſt:  1. <hi>The Rule or Canon of the Church, against thoſe that followed the Opinions of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57945:29"/>the</hi> Jews.  2. <hi>Concerning</hi> Eaſter.  3. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> III Speaking.  4. <hi>Some Diſputes about</hi> Faſting.  5. <hi>An Exhortation to</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, <hi>directed to the</hi> Neophytes.</p>
            <p>Having thus made ſome Particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon every one of his Works, and ſome General Ones on that Occaſion; what remains, is only to take notice of Three Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He often cites Suppoſitious Writings, as if they had been acknowledged by every Body, as one may obſerve by that Place of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Preaching,</hi> which I have alledg'd; and another of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which ſeems to have been taken out of the Book of his <hi>Travels;</hi> upon which <hi>Euſebius</hi> and St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> may be conſulted.</p>
            <p>Which may make one believe, that the great Reading of that Learned Man, gave him no refined Palate. One need not be a great Maſter of this ſort of Learning, to perceive, that what he cites out of them, doth not ſuit the Style of the Apoſtles, and is not agreeable to their Principles. It cannot be doubted, but that they believed, that the God whom the Jews worſhipped, was the True God, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and Father of Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſays ſo himſelf.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:57945:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Nor can the Jews be charged with having ſerved the <hi>Angels,</hi> the <hi>Month,</hi> and the <hi>Moon,</hi> with any probability; and the Reaſon which the Author of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Preaching</hi> gives for it, is ſo ridiculous, that none but ſuch as will be deceived, can be deceived by it. 'Tis true, that ſome<note n="*" place="margin">Huet. in Orig. T. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>212.</hi>
               </note> Learned Men have otherwiſe explained that Accuſation which that Author lays upon them; but one may eaſily ſee, by what follows, that he underſtood it in a more ſimple manner than they do.</p>
            <p>However, that Book being manifeſtly Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious,<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> T. <hi>14.</hi> in Joan.</note> 
               <hi>Origen</hi> dealt much more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently than his Maſter; ſince being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute <hi>Heracleon</hi> a Valentinian, who drew ſome Conſequences againſt the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from thoſe pretended words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he begins with ſaying, <hi>That one ſhould enquire whether that Book is truly St.</hi> Peter<hi>'s? whether it is not Suppoſititious? whether it be not Interpolated?</hi> and then he ſhews, that the Jews worſhipped the Creator of the World.</p>
            <p>But 'tis the Cuſtom of many Antients, to make uſe of all ſorts of Arguments and Books, to bring over Men to their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. If any ſhould uſe the ſame Method now, they would preſently be accuſed of Simplicity, or want of Honeſty: But every Age hath its Cuſtoms. However, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57945:30"/>that the Rules of Good Sence have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been the ſame; and 'tis not leſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Great Learning makes not a Man more Exact and Judicious, according to that famous Maxim of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> which <hi>Clemens</hi> cites ſome where, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Clemens</hi> is wont to explain the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Allegorically, without making his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories look likely, as 'twas the ordinary Cuſtom of the Antients. One may ſee what <hi>Huetius</hi> ſays concerning the Origin of Allegories, in his <hi>Origeniana, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>qu.</hi> 14. But if one carefully reads what <hi>Clemens</hi> ſays of it in the Fifth Book of his <hi>Stromata,</hi> where he doth ſomewhat enlarge upon this Matter, one may eaſily perceive, that that which chiefly induced him to believe that the Holy Scripture is full of them, is, becauſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> were wont to hide the Secrets of their Philoſophy under ſome Emblems and Fables. 'Tis true, that the Jews had the ſame Thoughts, even before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt. 'Tis true alſo, that in the remoteſt Times, that Nation expreſſed her ſelf not only by clear Words, but alſo by ſymbolical Actions, as it appears by ſeveral places of the Old Teſtament. However, there is not one Example, by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that they deſigned to hide the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57945:31"/>Doctrines of the Jewiſh Religion; which, on the contrary, they expreſs very clearly, and after a ſimple manner.</p>
            <p>There are but ſome few places of the Hiſtory of the Beginning of the World, which may be turned into Allegories with ſome likelihood; and only with reſpect to ſome Circumſtances, which do not at all concern the Eſſential part of the Hiſtory, nor belong to the Worſhip of God, Good Manners, or the Doctrines, without which they could not ſerve God, nor be Good Men, according to the Law. In all the reſt of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> there is nothing that looks like an Allegory, every thing in it is ſimple and eaſie to be underſtood; which makes one believe, that thoſe that wrote it, were no Allegoriſts; and that if there is any thing in the moſt ancient Events of the Hiſtory of Mankind, that may be underſtood that way, the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> took that turn, only becauſe Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the Memoirs upon which they wrote, were ſo worded.</p>
            <p>It doth not appear, that they deſigned to Philoſophize, or teach any Doctrines of Natural Philoſophy, either clearly or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely; and thoſe Places wherein <hi>Philo</hi> endeavours to find ſome Philoſophical Doctrines, are ſo violently wreſted, that any Body may ſee the Sacred Writers
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57945:31"/>never thought of what he makes them ſay.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if we reflect upon the Origin of Allegories among the Heathens, we ſhall find that they came out ſomewhat late: And when the Philoſophers undertook to give an Account of the Fables, or ancient Hiſtories of the Gods, that is, to ſave the Honour of their moſt ancient Hiſtorians, who were accuſed of having abſurd Notions of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Natures, as thoſe of the Gods were; ſo they were obliged to make thoſe, whom thoſe ſcandalous Hiſtories offended, believe, that the Poets meant quite another thing than what they ſaid, and from thence comes the word <hi>Allegory.</hi> For a<note n="*" place="margin">Heracl. Pont. Alleg. Hom. pag. <hi>412.</hi> Ed. Amſtelod. Weſtenianae.</note> Diſcourſe, which taken in its proper ſence (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) ſignifies quite another thing than what is meant by it, is properly an Allegory. Thus ſome Hiſtories were turned into Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> leſt they ſhould believe that the Gods of <hi>Greece</hi> had been only Vitious Men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews,</hi> who had never applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Study of Criticks and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, were no ſooner among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but they admired that Method of Explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion; and made uſe of it to explain the Sacred Writings after a manner more agreeable to the Taſte of the Heathens; as may be ſeen by the Example of <hi>Philo,</hi> who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57945:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>explains all the Old Teſtament after the <hi>Platonick</hi> way. Nay, they went ſo far, as to explain Allegorically not only ſuch Places as might have ſome difficulty, but alſo the cleareſt and plaineſt, without ſo much as excepting thoſe which concern Manners, and which being literally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, contain a moſt excellent ſence for the Conduct of one's Life; nor the plaineſt Hiſtories, and from which one may draw moſt uſeful Inſtructions, without looking for any other ſence, but that which offers it ſelf to the Mind. <hi>Philo</hi> is full of ſuch like Examples.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtians imitated the Jews after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and were not contented to explain the Old Teſtament Allegorically: They did the ſame with reſpect to the New, though neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles have propoſed any Doctrine after an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematick manner, but what they explained clearly enough, to ſave the trouble of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its meaning, by having recourſe to Allegories, in which there is no certainty. For it muſt be confeſt, that according to that Method, if the Sacred Writers had ſaid quite another thing than what they ſaid, or, if you will, the quite contrary; yet one might find as good a ſence in them, as thoſe, that will try it, will preſently obſerve. Hence it is, that the <hi>Pagans</hi> themſelves,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57945:32"/>who had been the Contrivers of that ſtrange way of interpreting ancient Books, could not abide that the Chriſtians ſhould make uſe of it; as the Chriſtians in their turn laught, at the ſtrained Interpretations of the Heathens. Nay, ſome Pagans, more quick-ſighted than others, thought they were ridiculous. Wherefore, the Chriſtians and the Jews would have done much better to keep cloſe to the Letter, than to uſe ſo uncertain a Method to defend the Holy Scripture againſt the Pagans.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Although ſeveral Opinions of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> may juſtly be accounted Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous; yet if we conſider every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Opinion which he held, and is no more admitted amongſt us, we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That ſome of them are lookt upon as Erroneous, only becauſe the contrary Opinions have been introduced, I know not how, into moſt Schools, though Men have had no New Light concerning them. As ſoon as a Famous Man hath maintained a Doctrine, without being contradicted by Men of an Equal Reputation or Authority, or even without any Oppoſition; ſuch a Doctrine takes root ſo well, that Men uſe themſelves, by degrees, to look upon the contrary Opinion as an Error, without knowing why.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57945:33"/>
            <p>Opinions are often introduced as Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, which owe their Beginning to the Example of ſome few Perſons, whom others imitate. They ſo affect Mens Mind, that any other beſides thoſe which he follows, ſeem to him ridiculous. A Garment which is not commonly ſeen, ſeems Extravagant, though it was Faſhionable in former Times: The ſame may be ſaid of an Opinion which is grown old, it is diſliked, becauſe no Body follows it at preſent. For Example,<note n="*" place="margin">Paed. l. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>101.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Clemens</hi> believed, that Angels had Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: And it was alſo the Opinion of<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniana Huetii, l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>2, 5.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Origen,</hi> and moſt of the Fathers. Yet that Opinion is branded as an Error, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reaſon: For although the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches us, that <hi>Spirits have neither Fleſh nor Bones,</hi> and that Angels are Intelligences; yet it ſays no where, that they are not cloathed with Bodies. There hath been no Revelation ſince upon that Matter, nor have we found out any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Reaſon that can perſuade us the contrary. Notwithſtanding, tis commonly ſaid that 'tis an Error, becauſe the School-Men have ſaid ſo. I confeſs, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who have aſcribed Bodies to the Angels, have alledged no evident Reaſon to prove it: But all that could be concluded from thence, is, that They affirmed a thing which They knew not no more than We.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:57945:33"/>
            <p>Thus we ſhould have ſuſpended our Judgment, and affirmed nothing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Subject which was equally unknown to us. Such a Suſpenſion ſuited not with the Dogmaticks, who can hardly confeſs that they know not all things; and believe 'tis the part of a Witty Man, to Determine himſelf ſpeedily upon all ſorts of Queſtions. Indeed, without this, 'tis not poſſible to frame a Syſtem as compleat as it ought to be, to be accounted a Learned Man: And it would be a ſhameful thing to confeſs, that a Thouſand Queſtions might be askt upon every Article; which could not be anſwered, if one ſhould ſay nothing but what one knows. The ſame Principle may be applied to ſeveral other Doctrines of <hi>Clemens;</hi> concerning which, 'twere better ingeniouſly to confeſs one's Ignorance, than to condemn ſome Opinions about which we are in the dark.</p>

            <p>What hath been ſaid, is ſufficient to have a Notion of the Doctrine of <hi>Clemens;</hi> I ſhall only add a word concerning the <hi>Cologne</hi> Edition, 1688. Two ſorts of Faults may be obſerved in it, whereof ſome are Common to it, with many other Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Books of the Antients; and the other are Particular to it.</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt, one may obſerve, That the Editions wherein there is no Diſtinctions and Paragraphs, want a thing which ſeems not to be of great moment in it ſelf, but yet doth very much conduce to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of an Author. The Beginning of a new Section, is as it were an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement to the Reader, who only by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Eye upon a Page, ſees how many
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57945:34"/>Arguments, and what Matter it contains. Elſe the want of diſtinct Paragraphs doth ſomewhat confound the Mind, and forces the Reader to be more attentive to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what he reads, and to look for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion where there is none, or confound two Arguments. Now, one ſhould always endeavour to leſſen, as much as can be, the Trouble of the Reader, who takes Pains enough to underſtand the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Paragraphs produce, in ſome reſpects, the ſame effect as the Diſtinction of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; which cannot be neglected, without breeding Confuſion. 'Tis true, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients often neglected to divide their Books or Diſcourſes into certain Parts: But if it be well conſider'd, the want of Order in many of their Writings, was the true cauſe of that Neglect. 'Twas eaſier to paſs from one ſubject to another, by reaſon of ſome ſmall Connexion that was between 'em, or confuſedly to write down a crowd of Thoughts, than to reduce 'em into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Order: as it would be more eaſie to heap up the Materials of a Houſe, than to give every one of them its due place. Thoſe who deſire ſome Examples of Books with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Order, need only caſt their Eyes upon <hi>Seneca</hi> or <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who both ſaid, with a great deal of Enthuſiaſm, whatever came
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57945:35"/>into their Mind, ſcarce ever having a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Order, which they deſign'd to follow. If thoſe Authors were printed ſo as to divide their Reaſonings by Paragraphs, they might be much better underſtood.</p>
            <p>The other Fault, which thoſe that take care of the Editions of Ancient Authors, often commit, is, that they do not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in a different Character the Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Words of the Author: From whence it comes to paſs, that thoſe who do not read them attentively, aſcribe to one Author what belongs to another. This Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> hath done, in his Engliſh Life of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> which hath been very uſeful to me in the writing of this. <hi>Clemens,</hi> in the above-mention'd place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Philoſophy which he approves, cites <hi>Socrates,</hi> who, in <hi>Phaedo,</hi> applies to the Philoſophers this Proverb, which was uſed in the Myſteries, <hi>There are many who carry the</hi> Thyrſus, <hi>but few that are truly filled with the Spirit of</hi> Bacchus.<note n="*" place="margin">P. <hi>380.</hi> Ed. Ficin.</note> 
               <hi>Socrates</hi> adds immediately after, <hi>Theſe, as I believe, are only thoſe who applied themſelves to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy as they ought to do, OF the Number whereof I have endeavoured to be, as much as I could,</hi> &amp;c. The whole Paſſage being in <hi>Roman</hi> Characters, Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> thought that thoſe words, <hi>Of the Number whereof,</hi> &amp;c. were <hi>Clemens</hi>'s; whereas they are <hi>Socrates</hi>'s
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57945:35"/>as may be ſeen in <hi>Plato,</hi> and even by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt of the Page wherein <hi>Clemens</hi> cites 'em. If the whole Paſſage had been printed in <hi>Italick</hi> Letters, Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> would not have miſtaken it: Which ought not to ſeem ſtrange to thoſe who know, that to write the Life of an Author, collected out of ſeveral places, ſo many things muſt be heeded all at once, that 'tis a hard matter not to confound one's ſelf.</p>
            <p>Beſides, by diſtinguiſhing the Matters by Paragraphs, and Quotations by different Characters, thoſe who have read an Author, may more eaſily find out again ſuch places as they want; which is no ſmall Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>As to the Edition of <hi>Cologne,</hi> there are Three <hi>Index</hi>'s; the firſt, of the Places cited by <hi>Clemens;</hi> the ſecond, of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; and a third, of Greek Words and Phraſes, either worthy of Obſervation, or ſuch as that Author hath uſed in a particular Sence. If thoſe <hi>Index</hi>'s were Compleat and Correct, they would be undoubtedly very uſeful; but they are neither: There is a great many Faults in the Numbers, and the Sence of <hi>Clemens</hi> is often miſ-repreſented in them. That Paſſage of <hi>Job, There is none but is polluted,</hi> is referred to the 25th. Chapter of his Book, whereas 'tis in the 14th. There is in the Index, <hi>Peccato origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nali
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57945:36"/>infectae omnium animae &amp; corpora,</hi> 468. <abbr>
                  <hi>d.</hi>
               </abbr> On the contrary, <hi>Clemens</hi> confutes that Opinion in that place; but <hi>Sylburgus,</hi> or another who made that <hi>Index,</hi> in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, thought of what <hi>Clemens</hi> ſhould have ſaid, in his judgment, rather than what he did really ſay.</p>
            <p>There is beſides a Fourth Index before the Book, which contains a Catalogue of the Authors cited by <hi>Clemens;</hi> but the Pages in which they are cited being not marked, 'tis altogether uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>'Twere to be wiſht, for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Learning, not only that Kings were Philoſophers, or Philoſophers Kings; but alſo, that Printers were Learned Men, or Learned Men Printers; and that we might ſee again the Age of the <hi>Manutius</hi>'s and <hi>Stephens,</hi> to give us good Editions of the Writings of the Antients, and make that Study more Eaſie, which is Difficult enough of it ſelf, without encreaſing the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by our own Negligence.</p>

            <p>

He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan early to apply himſelf to Learning, eſpecially to Divinity, as it ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his Writings, wherein may be ſeen, that he had carefully read all ſorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Authors; and that all the Writings of the Chriſtians who wrote in Greek, and thoſe of the Latin, that were tranſlated into that Tongue, were known to him. He had the advantage of the curious Library which the Martyr <hi>Pamphilius,</hi> his particular Friend, had collected at <hi>Caeſarea.</hi> Its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,<note n="*" place="margin">Hieron.

However, he has committed Faults enough in Chronology, as <hi>Joſeph Scaliger,</hi> and a great many other Learned Men have obſerved; and eſpecially in relation to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, as Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> has lately ſhewn in his Diſſertation <hi>de Paucitate Martyrum.</hi> But it was no eaſie Matter to eſcape theſe kind of Faults in ſuch a Work as his <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Hiſtory,</hi> which was the firſt of that ſort that was ever undertaken; the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

            <p>It was about this time, that <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had a bickering with one of his Prieſts named <hi>Arius,</hi> touching the Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> which gave birth to <hi>Arianiſm.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57945:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>aſcend higher, and enquire what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Philoſophy were in uſe in that time among the Chriſtians, and how they came to be introduced.

            <p>There was never any Philoſopher that made himſelf ſo Famous as <hi>Plato,</hi> and no Books read with more Pleaſure than his, whether from the Subjects, and lofty Thoughts found therein, or by reaſon of the Elegancy and Nobleneſs of their Style, which never any Philoſopher could equalize.

            <p>The <hi>Platoniſts</hi> likewiſe uſed, in ſpeaking of the Union which they conceiv'd to be between the different Orders of their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, the terms of (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) as Material things, or which are otherwiſe divided; this Union, I ſay, happens to 'em from Superior things, and deſtroys it ſelf at a certain time. But the more we elevate
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57945:43"/>our ſelves to Superior things, and to the Identity (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) which is Eternal, and the more we ſee what is the Union properly ſo called, and the Model whereon all the reſt have been form'd, and that it hath about it, and in it ſelf, the Diverſity (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Porphyry</hi> had ask'd, Whether a kind of Being is form'd (<gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Jamblichus</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>No:</hi> and gives this Reaſon for it; which is, <hi>That when One thing is form'd of Two, the Whole is of one and the ſame Species, of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Co-eſſential</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,) <hi>and that this does not happen in the caſe propoſed by</hi> Porphyry.</p>
            <p>One may ſee hereby the Subtilty with which the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> handled theſe Matters, and the Terms they uſed. But we ſhould take notice of two things, in endeavouring to form to our ſelves an Idea of their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The firſt, That we muſt not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuppoſe they had a clear and diſtinct Knowledge of what they would ſay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57945:44"/>and that they ſaw all the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of their Opinions: So that it would be perhaps in vain, to endeavour to draw out of their Writings a clear Idea of their Sentiment, touching the Three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all things; becauſe, perhaps they themſelves conceiv'd not clearly what they ſaid; at leaſt, their Style is ſo different on this occaſion, from that which is obſervable in the Paſſages of their Writings, wherein they ſpeak of things which they may know, that it is apparent, they contain'd not the ſubject of the Three Principles, like an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite of others, which they have known how to expreſs in an even, clear and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant manner.</p>
            <p>The Second thing we ſhould obſerve, is, That in ſo difficult a Matter, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with what they ſay poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, without attempting to draw far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetch'd Conſequences from their Principles, which we cannot underſtand but by halves; otherwiſe we are in danger of attributing to them ſuch Notions as they never had. Neither muſt we endeavour to reconcile, in ſo abſtracted a Subject, the Contradictions which ſeem to appear in their Doctrine; nor conclude, that they could not mean things in ſuch a manner, becauſe then they muſt contradict themſelves. It was the Cuſtom of theſe Philoſophers, to affect cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57945:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>apparent Contradictions, in uſing the ſame Terms in divers Sences. Beſides, its obvious enough to imagine, that they may have ſometimes contradicted themſelves, on a Subject whereof they had no diſtinct Idea.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Remarks were neceſſary, to prevent the Queſtions which might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd on theſe Matters; and to ſhew, that in writing the Hiſtory of theſe Doctrines, one ſhould keep wholly to Facts, and the Terms of the Authors we treat of.</p>
            <p>A Second Opinion of the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> which has made a great noiſe in the World, is that of the Prae-exiſtence of Souls, in places above the Moon,<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s <hi>Timoens.</hi>
               </note> of the Faults which they may have there committed; of their baniſhments from theſe happy Abodes, to come to inhabit in differently diſpoſed Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, according to the different Merits of theſe Souls; in fine, of their return into places whence they drew their Original. We ſhall not trouble our ſelves to explain this Doctrine, becauſe it belongs not to the Relation in hand; having only made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, for a particular Reaſon which will appear in its place.</p>
            <p>The Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> having carried the Sciences of the <hi>Greeks</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were in great numbers in theſe two Kingdoms, and who were obliged
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57945:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>to converſe with them, learn'd of them their Opinions; and made no difficulty of embracing thoſe, which did not appear to 'em contrary to their Religion. Their Books containing nothing inconſiſtent with ſundry of the <hi>Platonick</hi> Doctrines; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved therefore that theſe Doctrines might be true, and receiv'd them ſo much the more eaſily, in that they thought they might hereby defend their Religion againſt the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and make them reliſh it the better. <hi>Plato</hi> every where affirm'd the Unity of the Supreme Being, yet without denying that there are other Beings which may be called <hi>Gods,</hi> to wit, the Angels, which is agreeable to the Expreſſions of the Old Teſtament. And this is apparently one of the things which made the <hi>Jews</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reliſh the Opinions of this Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</p>
            <p>But we ſhould give ſome particular Proofs of this: The Author of the Book of the <hi>Wiſdom of Solomon,</hi> was plainly of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Prae-exiſtence of Souls, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from theſe words of <hi>chap.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. <hi>For I was a witty Child, and had a good Spirit: Yea, rather, being good, I came into a Body undefiled.</hi> The ſame Author has uſed the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>Reaſon,</hi> in ſome places, where <hi>Plato</hi> would have uſed it, were he to have ſaid the ſame thing. Thus
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57945:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>in <hi>chap.</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. in ſpeaking of the Deliverer of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Thy Almighty Reaſon deſcended from Heaven, out of thy Royal Throne, as a fierce Man of War into the midſt of a Land of Deſtruction, and brought thine unfeigned Commandment, as a ſharp Sword; and ſtanding up, fill'd all things with Death; and it touched the Heaven, but it ſtood upon the Earth.</hi> In <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. he ſays, That <hi>God has made all things by his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> It cannot be alledg'd, that he has been the only one of the <hi>Jews</hi> that has ſpoke in this manner; ſeeing that <hi>Philo,</hi> who liv'd a little while after Our Saviour, is full of the like Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; as ſeveral of the Learned have obſerved. Its known that this Author has ſo well imitated <hi>Plato,</hi> that he has been call'd the <hi>Jewiſh Plato.</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that there was One only Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God, as all the reſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> do, whom he calls TO ON, the <hi>Being through Excellency.</hi> But he further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd a Divine Nature, which he calls ΛΟΓΟΣ, the <hi>Reaſon;</hi> as well as <hi>Plato:</hi> And another whom he calls likewiſe the <hi>Soul of the World.</hi> His Writings are ſo full of theſe manner of ſpeaking, that there is no nead of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſ.

            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were of theſe Opinions when Our Saviour and his Apoſtles came into the World: And this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Reaſon why we find, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as it has been obſerved by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral learned Men, ſeveral Platonick Phraſes in the New Teſtament, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Goſpel of St. <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's well known, that <hi>Amelius</hi> the Platonick Philoſopher, having read the beginning of this Goſpel, remarked, that this Apoſtle ſpake like <hi>Plato.</hi> In effect, this Philoſopher might have ſaid, according to his Principles, <hi>The Reaſon was in the beginning with God.

            <p>We might give ſeveral other Examples of Platonick Phraſes, to be met with in the New Teſtament: But it will be ſufficient to remark here, That the Apoſtles apply to our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which <hi>Philo</hi> had applied to the <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and that this Jewiſh Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher

Thus the <hi>Ebionites</hi> are charged to have denied the Pre-exiſtence of Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Divinity, and to have held that he was only a meer Man. Theſe <hi>Ebionites</hi> have remain'd a long time, ſeeing that not only <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> do men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them, but St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſeems to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that they were in his time. It's affirm'd, That <hi>Artemon,</hi> under the Emperor <hi>Severus,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> under the Emperor <hi>Aurelius,</hi> maintain'd the ſame Opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> on the contrary, held the Pre-exiſtence of the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which he call'd the <hi>Christ;</hi> and affirm'd, that ſhe had deſcended on Jeſus, in the form of a Dove, when he was Baptiz'd; and that ſhe aſcended up into Heaven, when he was Crucify'd. It is indeed very difficult to affirm, that this was preciſely the Opinions of theſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, becauſe we have nothing remaining to us of them, and that we cannot fully truſt thoſe who ſpeak of 'em only with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57945:49"/>ſeeing it might eaſily be, that their great Zeal has hindred them from well comprehending them. And this is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark which we muſt make, in reſpect of all the Ancient Hereticks, whoſe Opinions are denoted to us only from the Writings of their Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>About the Middle of the Third Century, <hi>Sabellius</hi> of <hi>Ptolemaïs</hi> in <hi>Lybia,</hi> produced a new Opinion, which was condemned in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and afterwards every where.

It ſeems, that <hi>Sabellius</hi> would acknowledge but One, whom he call'd the Father, the Son, or Holy Spirit, in divers regards. It's ſaid that ſome others had maintain'd the ſame thing before and after him, as <hi>Noet</hi> and <hi>Beryllus</hi> of <hi>Botſra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A while after <hi>Sabellius,</hi> appear'd <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who was (as we have ſaid) of the <hi>Ebionites</hi> Sentiment, in relation to our Saviour's Divinity. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:57945:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Theſe are the chief Heretical Opinions touching the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt, which appear'd before the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> As for the Fathers, which are reſpected as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, they have not varied from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the <hi>Platoniſts;</hi> and as theſe have ſometimes ſaid, that the Reaſon is different from the Supreme Being; and ſometimes, that they are both one. The Fathers have expreſt themſelves in the ſame terms. The <hi>Platoniſts</hi> have ſaid, That the Father could not be without the Son, nor the Son without the Father; as the Light could not be without the Sun, nor the Sun without Light: And the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ſaid the ſame thing. Both one and the other have acknowledged that the Reaſon has exiſted before the World, and that ſhe has produced it; and as <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaks in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> and <hi>Plotinus</hi> in his <hi>Enneades,</hi> of the Generation of Reaſon, as if the Good it ſelf had produced it, to create and govern the World: So the Fathers have ſaid, that the Son hath proceeded in ſome manner from the Father, before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, to manifeſt himſelf to Men by his Production; and that hence it is that the Scripture calls him the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and his <hi>First-born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes they ſay there was a time in which the Son was not; ſometimes, that he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57945:50"/>was from Everlaſting as well as the Father; ſometimes they affirm they are Equal; and elſewhere they ſay the Father is Greateſt. Some of them believe that the Father and Son are <hi>two Hypoſtaſes, two Natures, two Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences,</hi> as appears from the paſſage of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> related by<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Photius;</hi> others deny it. To bring Inſtances of all this, would be too great an Enlargement for this place; and there being enough to be ſeen in <hi>Bull</hi>'s Book which we have already cited.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded at preſent, what <hi>Idea</hi>'s they fix'd to theſe Expreſſions; it cannot be affirm'd that they have been clear. Firſt, Becauſe whatever Endeavours are uſed to underſtand what they ſay, a Man can get no diſtinct Notion thereof. And, Secondly, Becauſe they acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that it is a thing Incomprehenſible. All that can be done on this occaſion, is to relate the Terms which they have uſed, to the end that it may be ſeen how they have heretofore expreſt themſelves on this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. However, learned Men have given themſelves a great deal of trouble to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Paſſages of the Fathers who liv'd before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that all their Explications are fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; ſeeing the Fathers, in acknowledging, that what they ſaid was Incomprehenſible, acknowledg'd at the ſame time, that they
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57945:51"/>fix'd no <hi>Idea</hi> on the Terms they uſed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuch as were general and confuſed.</p>
            <p>Had the Matter ſtaid here, there had never been ſuch great Diſputes on the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the Antients, touching this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; ſeeing the Diſpute doth not ſo much lie on the Terms they have uſed, as the Idea's they have faſten'd to them, which cannot be reduced to any thing that is clear. Sometimes they uſe Terms which ſeem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to agree with thoſe which have been uſed ſince; but there is found in ſome other places of their Works, Expreſſions which ſeem to overthrow what they had ſaid; ſo that one cannot form any Notion of what they thought.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lactantius,</hi> for Example, anſwers thus to the Heathens, who ask'd the Chriſtians, how they ſaid they acknowledged but One God, ſeeing they gave this Name to the Father, and to the Son? <q rend="margQuotes">

            <p>
               <hi>Lactantius</hi> has been long ſince charg'd with Heterodoxy; but in this reſpect, he has been no more faulty than other Fathers, who liv'd before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> whoſe Expreſſions are as different as thoſe of the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> in matter of the Trinity.

In this compariſon, their Expreſſions are found ſo obſcure, and ſo full of apparent Contradictions, or real ones, that a Man feels himſelf obliged to believe that the Fathers had done a great deal bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in keeping themſelves to the Terms of the Apoſtles; and to have acknowledged, that they underſtood them not, than to throw themſelves into ſuch Labyrinths, by endeavouring to explain them.</p>
            <p>To ſhew further, That the Expreſſions of the Fathers are only fit to produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Notions, and ſuch as are contrary to thoſe which all Chriſtians at this day hold;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57945:53"/>we need only read <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who having ſaid, in his <hi>Apology, chap.</hi> 21.

And what he adds, ſeems to favour this laſt ſence; <hi>Etiam cum radius ex ſole porrigitur, portio ex ſumma, ſed Sol erit in radio, quia Solis est radius; nec ſeparatur ſubſtantia, ſed extenditur.</hi> The Subſtance of a Ray, after what manner ſoever we conceive it, is not the ſame in <hi>Number</hi> as that of the Sun: And <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays, that it is the ſame of the Son; <hi>Ita de Spiritu Spiritus, &amp; de Deo Deus;</hi> Thus a Spirit is born of a Spirit, and a God of a God. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Lumen de lumine accenditur, manet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegra, &amp; indefecta materiae matrix, etſi plures inde traduces qualitatum mutueris;</hi> As when we light one Torch by another, the Light which has lighted the other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains entire, and without being waſted, although we light ſeveral Torches, who have the ſame qualities. <hi>Ita &amp; quod de Deo profectum est, Deus est, &amp; Dei Filius

            <p>Theſe Words of <hi>Tertullian</hi> do not appear at firſt ſight agreeable with <hi>Arius</hi>'s Opinion; but at moſt, they contain nothing that is clear; for one might have demanded of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> whether by this <hi>Prolation</hi> he ſpeaks of, the Reaſon has exiſted as Light from a Torch, lighted by another Torch, exiſts as ſoon as it is lighted? Should he allow it, he might have been told, that to ſpeak ſtrictly, there muſt have been Two Gods; ſeeing that, in fine, two Spirits, though exactly equal, and ſtrictly united, are two Spirits. If this be ſo, the ſecond Spirit being not form'd of the ſame Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Subſtance, as that of the firſt, one might ſay with <hi>Arius,</hi> that he has been <hi>extracted from nothing;</hi> and there would be in this regard, nothing but a Diſpute about Words, between <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi> But if it be anſwer'd for <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:57945:54"/>That his Compariſon is not good; it will be ask'd, Why he made uſe of a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon which may lead into Error, eſpecially having ſaid before, that he was of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinion touching the <hi>Reaſon?</hi> If he meant, that the Father has produced in his proper Subſtance, without multiplying it, a <hi>Modification,</hi> in reſpect of which, one may call the Subſtance of the Father, Son; why does he ſay, <hi>Spiritus ex Spiritu, ex Deo, Deus?</hi> For, to ſpeak properly, the Father has produced neither a Spirit, nor a God, but a new manner of Being in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subſtance.</p>
            <p>It is further to be obſerved, That this Compariſon is not of <hi>Tertullian</hi> alone, but of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and a great number of Fathers beſides, before and after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice;</hi> and that there is no Paſſage which appears of greater force than that, yet the Equivocation of it is apparent.</p>
            <p>The Fathers have likewiſe uſed the term <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> as well as the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> in two ſences; ſometimes for the Exiſtence taken in an abſtracted manner, and ſometimes for the thing it ſelf, which exiſts. The Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of this Term, and that of the Words, <hi>One and Many,</hi> which (as has been ſhew'd) are taken ſometimes from the Unity, and the Plurality <hi>Specificials;</hi> and ſometimes from the Unity and Plurality
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57945:54"/>
               <hi>Numericals,</hi> have caus'd great Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies among the Fathers, as divers learned Men have<note n="*" place="margin">Petavius, Curcellaeus, Huetius, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> obſerved. But it is ſit we ſhould take notice of one thing, which is, that <hi>Bull,</hi> who has writ prolixly on this Matter, has not a word of the <hi>Numerical</hi> and <hi>Specifick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> without which, a Man cannot comprehend what the Fathers mean, nor draw any Concluſions from them againſt the Hereticks. Yet when they ſay there are <hi>three Hypoſtaſes,</hi> or <hi>three Eſſences,</hi> or <hi>three Natures,</hi> he conſtantly takes it as if they ſaid, there are three Modifications in one only Numerical Eſſence. He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Nature,</hi> ſignifie Manners of Exiſting of one Numerical Eſſence, only becauſe that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, thoſe who have thus ſpoken of it, would not have been Orthodox, or of the Opinion at preſent receiv'd, which the Council muſt have approv'd of, ſeeing otherwiſe it would not have been admitted as it is. He ſuppoſes, on the contrary, for the ſame Reaſons, that when the Fathers deny there are Three <hi>Hypoſtaſes,</hi> they do not barely mean, that there are not Three Eſſences of different Kinds, but that they are not Three in Number. But others will deny there is any place, where the words <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Eſſence</hi> can be taken for what we at this day call Perſonality, which is to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57945:55"/>ſay, for a Modification; and that it appears from the Paſſages which he cites, that the Fathers held the <hi>Numerical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this was the Condition of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, when the Quarrels of <hi>Arius</hi> diſturb'd it. Whence may be ſeen, that it was no hard matter for the two Parties to cite Authorities of the Antients, whoſe Equivocal Expreſſions might be interpreted in divers ſences. The Obſcurity of the Subject, the vain Subtilty of Humane Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which would know every thing, the Deſire of appearing able, and the Paſſion which mingles it ſelf in all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, gave Birth to theſe Controverſies, which for a long time tore Chriſtianity into pieces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arius</hi> being a Prieſt of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> about the Year 318, undertook, as it ſeems, to explain more clearly the Doctrine of the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt, which had been till that time taught in the Chriſtian Church, under the Veil of thoſe Terms which we have recited. He ſaid, that to <hi>beget,</hi> in this ſubject, was nothing elſe but to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce:</hi> whence he concluded, that the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Jeſus Chriſt had been extracted out of nothing by the Father. Here's how he expreſſes himſelf, in a Letter which he wrote to <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nicomedia:</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </note> 
               <hi>Melece.</hi> Biſhop in <hi>Thebais,</hi> who had caus'd a Schiſm in <hi>Egypt,</hi> although he did not much vary from the common Opinions, only becauſe he would not receive into Communion the Prieſts who had faln in the <hi>Diocleſian</hi> Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but after a long Penance, and would have them for ever depriv'd of their Office.</p>
            <p>One may ſee the Hiſtory of this in St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who accuſes him for having (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) an affected Devotion, and taking up a particular way of living, to to make himſelf admired by the People. <hi>Arius</hi> had moreover another Enemy, named <hi>Alexander,</hi> and Sirnamed <hi>Baucalas</hi>

He could the better ſpread his Opinions, in that having a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church at <hi>Alexandria</hi> committed<note n="*" place="margin">Epiph.</note> to his care, he preach'd there what he thought fit. He drew ſuch a great number of People into his Opinions, that there were Seven hundred Religious Votaries who had embraced them, and conſequently a greater number among the Ordinary People.

               <note n="†" place="margin">Sozom.</note>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> thought, that in a Matter wherein one might eaſily equivocate, it were beſt to let the two Parties explain themſelves, to the end it might appear, that he had accorded them more by Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion than Force. He brought the two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to a Conference, in demanding of them the Explication of a Paſſage of Scripture, in the Preſence of the Clergy of his Church: But neither one nor the other of theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would yield, endeavouring only to vanquiſh. <hi>Arius</hi> his Adverſaries main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that the Son is of the ſame Eſſence (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) as the Father, and that he is Eternal as he is; and <hi>Arius</hi> pretended that the Generation denoted a Beginning. There was another Meeting call'd, as fruitleſs as the firſt, in reſpect of the Diſpute; but by which, it ſeems, <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57945:56"/>not any preciſe determined Sentiment on this Matter, was induced to embrace the Opinion of <hi>Arius</hi> his Adverſaries. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards commanded this Prieſt to <hi>believe</hi> the ſame thing (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) and to abandon the oppoſite Opinion.</p>
            <p>But it being ſeldom known that Men yield Obedience to theſe kind of Injunctions, <hi>Arius</hi> remained ſtill in the ſame Opinion, as well as ſeveral other Biſhops and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks who had approved of it. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> angry at his not being obey'd, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated him, with all thoſe of his Party, and oblig'd him to depart out of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> There were, among others, five Prieſts of this City, and as many Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons of the ſame Church, beſides ſome Biſhops of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as <hi>Secondas</hi> and <hi>Theonas.</hi> To them were joined a great number of People, ſome of which did in effect approve the Doctrine of <hi>Arius,</hi> and others thought that he had been condemned with too high an hand, without entring into the Diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Controverſie.</p>
            <p>After this Severity, the two Parties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make their Opinions and Conduct be approved by Letters which they ſent every where. They expoſed not only their Reaſons, but endeavoured to render odious the oppoſite Party, by the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences they drew from their Opinions and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57945:57"/>in attributing to them ſtrange Expreſſions. Some Biſhops, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> exhorted <hi>Alexander</hi> to reconcile himſelf with <hi>Arius,</hi> and others approv'd his Conduct, and adviſed him not to receive him into his Communion till he retracted.</p>

            <p>Afterwards, a <hi>Creed</hi> was undertaken to be made, wherein the Opinions contrary to thoſe of <hi>Arius</hi> were eſtabliſhed.

And Scripture Phraſes were to be uſed, ſuch as theſe; <hi>That the Son is Only-Begotten, the Reaſon, Power, Wiſdom of the Father, the Brightneſs of his Glory, and Character of his Power.</hi> The <hi>Arians</hi> having ſhew'd that they were ready to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Confeſſion expreſt in theſe terms: the Orthodox Biſhops feard leſt they ſhould expound theſe terms in an ill ſence. And therefore they were for adding, <hi>That the Son is of the Subſtance of the Father;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is that which diſtinguiſhes the Son from the Creatures. Hereupon the <hi>Arians</hi> were ask'd, whether they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, <hi>That the Son is not a Creature, but the Power, the only Wiſdom and Image of the Father; That he is Eternal, and like to the Father in all things;</hi> in fine, <hi>True God.</hi> The

            </p>
            <p>Afterwards the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> was read, which had been drawn up with this Word, the Terms of which have been already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. <hi>Anathema's</hi> were join'd thereto, againſt thoſe who ſhould uſe, on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, other Terms than thoſe of the Holy Scripture; which muſt be underſtood, with an Exception of thoſe which the Council thought fit to Conſecrate.</p>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57945:66"/>and Anathema's might be explained.  1. It was ſaid, That the word <hi>Begotten,</hi> and not <hi>Made,</hi> was uſed; becauſe this laſt word expreſſes the Production of Creatures, to which the Son has no likeneſs, being of a Subſtance far more excellent than they, begotten by the Father in an incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible manner.  2. As for the word <hi>Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial,</hi> it is proper to the Son, not in the ſence wherein it is taken, when we ſpeak of Bodies, or Mortal Animals, the Son be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſubſtantial with the Father, neither by a Diviſion of the Divine Subſtance, of which he poſſeſſes a part, nor by any change of this ſame Subſtance. The meaning of which is only this, That the Son has no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with the Creatures which he has made; but, that he is in all things like to his Father, by whom he has been begotten; or, That he is not of another Hypoſtaſis, or Subſtance, but of that of the Father.  3. Thoſe were condemn'd, who ſaid, That the Son was not before he was born, ſeeing that he exiſted before his Corporal Birth, and even before his Divine Generation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Argument: <q rend="margQuotes">

            <p>
               <hi>Arius,</hi> if we believe the Orthodox, had not the Courage to reſolve on Baniſhment with <hi>Secondus</hi> and <hi>Theonas:</hi> He pretended a deſire to be better inſtructed, and ſought an occaſion of conferring with <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>

            <p>The Council ending the 25th. of <hi>August, Conſtantine</hi> took his farewel of them, in a

               </note> wherein he exhorted the Fathers to thoughts of Peace, and to a mutual Forbearance; but which was of little effect, as will appear by the ſequel.</p>
            <p>Thus ended this famous Council, the Circumſtances of which would be better known to us, if the fear of offending great Perſons, the Zeal of ſome, the Paſſion of others, and the Reſpect which Poſterity has had for the Deciſions of ſo famous an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, had not hinder'd contemporary Authors from writing the Hiſtory with the Exactneſs and Impartiality remarkable in good Hiſtorians; and retain'd thoſe who have liv'd ſince, from ſaying what they knew (perhaps) that was diſadvantagious. St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in a little Treatiſe already cited, and where he ſeems at firſt to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enter on this Hiſtory, tranſported by the Zeal of which he was full, falls on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie and Invectives, when one might expect him ready to relate Circumſtances. <hi>Sozomen</hi> ſays, <hi>That he did not dare to relate the Creed of</hi> Nice;<note n="†" place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> c. 10.</note>

            <p>The Heterodox affirm, on the contrary, that the <hi>Meletians</hi> being re-united to the Catholicks, after the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> fifty four Biſhops of <hi>Egypt</hi> took an Oath to elect by common Conſent his Succeſſor, but that ſeven among them broke their Oaths, and choſe <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> without the Participation of the reſt.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57945:71"/>but heating our ſelves as we do, for the Truth, as well as for Error, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding ſometimes the right ſide by indirect ways, it would not be ſafe to reject what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Heterodox ſay, or blindly receive whatever the Orthodox relate.</p>
            <p>It ſeems, about this time, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made his Conſtitution<note n="*" place="margin">Euſeb. in ejus Vit. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>64.</hi>

But ſome doing it ſincerely, and others by force, the Biſhops applied themſelves care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to diſtinguiſh them, and receiv'd only into the Church thoſe who were real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts. The <hi>Arians</hi> had been ruin'd by particular Edicts, ſo that all Hereſies ſeem'd to be aboliſh'd in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who had at firſt ſlighted the Subject of the Diſpute between <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> as conſiſting only of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Expreſſions, and who afterwards had conſidered it as a Point of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,

               <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> Siſter of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and Widow of <hi>Lucinus,</hi> had among her Domeſticks, a Prieſt, a Friend to <hi>Arius,</hi> who held the ſame Opinions as he did, and who perſuaded this Princeſs that <hi>Arius</hi> held not thoſe Opinions he was charged with, in the manner as they were uſually expreſs'd; that <hi>Alexander</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him through Envy, becauſe he was eſteem'd by the People; and that the Council had done him wrong. <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> who much confided in this Prieſt, eaſily believed him, but dared not ſpeak her Mind to the Emperor; and being faln dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſick, all that ſhe could do before ſhe died, was to recommend this Prieſt to her Brother, as a Man highly Vertuous, and much devoted to the Service of her Family. A while after ſhe died, and this Prieſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten the Favour of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> held to him the ſame Diſcourſe, telling him, That if he pleas'd to admit <hi>Arius</hi> to come before him, and to explain his Opinion, he would find, that at bottom, his Doctrine was the ſame as that of the Council which condemn'd him.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:57945:72"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſurpriz'd at the oddneſs of this Diſcourſe, anſwered, That if <hi>Arius</hi> would ſign the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> he would let him come into his Preſence, and would ſend him honourably to <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Prieſt having aſſured him of it, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſent Word to <hi>Arius</hi> to come to Court; and <hi>Arius</hi> not daring at firſt to do it, the Emperor wrote a Note to him, in which he ordered him to come immediately at his Charge. <hi>Arius</hi> obeyed this reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Order; and being come to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> with <hi>Euzoius,</hi> they preſented to the Emperor a Confeſſion of their Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they barely ſaid, <hi>They belev'd that the Son was begotten of the Father before all Ages; and that the Reaſon, who is God, had made all things, as well in Heaven as in Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was fully ſatisfied with this Declaration, either he had chang'd his Mind, or given ſmall Attention to it, or little comprehended the Sence of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed. However it was, it appears by the ſequel, that the <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhops came by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees into Favour, and that the Emperor treated <hi>Arius</hi> with great Kindneſs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to return to <hi>Alexandria.</hi>

            <p>It's not punctually known when <hi>Arius</hi> was recall'd; but it's certain he had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, when <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Theoguis</hi> were,

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57945:73"/>of the Biſhops; as when <hi>Socrates</hi> ſays that the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> forbad <hi>Arius</hi>'s return to <hi>Alexander,</hi> whereas it was the Emperor. But in truth, the Emperor did then few things of his own pure motion, being only the Church-mens Tool; which falls out but too often, even among the greateſt Princes.</p>
            <p>The Letter of <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Theognis</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the effect which they hoped from it.

On the contrary, thoſe who ſtuck to the word <hi>Conſubſtantial,</hi> imagining the others would introduce a Plurality of Gods, had as great an averſion for it, as if they would have re-eſtabliſh'd Paganiſm. <hi>Euſtathius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> accuſed <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea</hi> of corrupting the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius denied it,</hi> and charged, on the other ſide, <hi>Eustathius</hi> with <hi>Sabellianiſm.</hi> Thus the Biſhops wrote one againſt another.

            <p>The Obſtinacy of this Biſhop, who would part with none of the Advantages
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57945:75"/>which the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had granted to his Predeceſſor againſt the <hi>Meletians,</hi> had alſo drawn on him the Enmity of theſe Schiſmaticks.

However, <hi>Melece,</hi> at his death, had ordained one <hi>John</hi> for his Succeſſor, and the <hi>Mele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Prieſts would have the ſame Privileges as others. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> could not conſent to any thing of this, and equally ill treated the <hi>Meletians</hi> and <hi>Arians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Conduct re-united the two Parties, who had been till that time oppoſite. The <hi>Meletians</hi> were of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Opinion; but by converſing with the <hi>Arians,</hi> they ſoon entred into their Sentiments, and join'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to induce <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to accept of ſeveral Accuſations againſt <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> as having impoſed a kind of Tribute on <hi>Egypt,</hi> in ordering it to furniſh the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> with a certain number of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Garments; in having ſupplied a certain ſeditious Perſon with Money, named <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumenus;</hi> in having cauſed a Chalice to be broken, overthrown the Table of a Church, and burnt the Holy Books; for having miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed ſeveral Prieſts, and committed divers

            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantine</hi> acknowledged the Innocency of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in regard of the two firſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations; and for the reſt, he referr'd it to an Aſſembly of divers Biſhops which was at <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> where <hi>Athanaſius</hi> not appearing, he was cited to a Synod at <hi>Tyre,</hi> in the Year 334, and which conſiſted of Biſhops of <hi>Egypt, Lybia, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was in ſuſpence, whether he ſhould preſent himſelf to this Synod, which conſiſted of his principal Enemies: Yet <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> having threatned him with Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if he refuſed, he therefore appeared, and juſtified himſelf of the Accuſation touching the Arm of <hi>Arſinius,</hi> by bringing in this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into the midſt of them, and deriding his Accuſers. It's ſaid moreover, that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being introduced into the Aſſembly, accuſed him for having diſhonoured her, after ſhe had entertain'd him in her Houſe, although he knew ſhe had made a Vow of Virginity. But it appeared, that ſhe did not ſo much as know <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> ſeeing ſhe took one <hi>Timotheus</hi> a Prieſt for him, who pretended to be the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The buſineſs of the broken Chalice, and the miſuſing the Prieſts, was a little more
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57945:76"/>difficult. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> began by an Appeal from <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and the reſt of the Biſhops of his Party. He afterwards ſaid, That he whoſe Chalice was pretended to have been broken, and whoſe Name was <hi>Iſchyras,</hi> was not a Prieſt. However, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to theſe Reaſons, there were ſent ſome <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhops, to take In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations againſt him at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with <hi>Iſchyras</hi> his Accuſer; but he proteſted high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt this Proceeding, and went to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> where the Emperor was.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Informations from <hi>Egypt</hi> were received, and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> being loaded with them, he was depoſed in his abſence, and forbid to go to <hi>Alexandria. Arſenius</hi> having been admitted into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion by the Council, and made Biſhop of <hi>Hypſyle,</hi> a Town of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſubſcribed to the Depoſition of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> although he had juſtified him, in reference to one of the Accuſations brought againſt him. The Sentence of the Council bore, That he had flighted the Emperor's Orders, and made the Aſſembly wait for him in an indecent manner; That he came to <hi>Tyre</hi> with a great multitude of People, and endeavoured to make a Diſturbance there; That he had for ſome time refuſed to purge himſelf of the Crimes laid to his Charge, and uttered Injuries to divers Biſhops; That he would
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57945:77"/>not ſubmit to their Judgment; That he was convicted of breaking a Chalice, by the Informations made againſt him at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Athanaſius</hi> condemned by his Enemies, who were his Judges, as <hi>Arius</hi> had been anathematiz'd by <hi>Alexander</hi> his Predeceſſor, and ſeveral other Biſhops, who had declared themſelves againſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Convocation of the Council. The ſame uſage has been obſerved in all the Aſſemblies of Biſhops which have met ſince; the Clergy having this Advantage above the Laity, that they can be both Judges and Parties.</p>
            <p>After the Depoſal of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror wrote to the Fathers of the Council, to repair as ſoon as poſſible to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to celebrate the Dedication of the Church of the Apoſtles, which was now finiſhed. Where being arriv'd, they were magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently receiv'd, and made ſeveral Orations, for the greater Solemnity of the Feſtival, which happened to be very luckily, in the ſame Year in which the <hi>Tricennales</hi> of the Emperor<note n="*" place="margin">In the Year 335.</note> were to be celebrated, which is to ſay, the 30th.

               <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> particularly made ſeveral Harrangues before the Emperor, who took a great deal of pleaſure in hearing them, inſomuch that he would hear ſtanding a long Oration which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57945:77"/>this Biſhop made on the holy Sepulchre. <hi>Euſebius</hi> well remembers this Honour the Emperor did him, and the Praiſes he gave to his Oration touching <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inſerts, in the Life of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> all the Letters he had received from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; perhaps, not out of Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but rather to do himſelf Honour,<note n="*" place="margin">Baronius ad haec Tempora,</note> as he has been reproach'd with it.</p>

This latter ſeems to have thought himſelf obliged to't through Chriſtian Charity; but others are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that Chriſtian Charity, that is, the Love we ought to have for all Chriſtians, ſhould oblige all Hiſtorians to mention ſuch Truths, as make no Alteration in the ſtate of thoſe that are Dead; and are very uſeful to the Living, who learn thereby to judge ſoundly of things.

            <p>
               <hi>Euſebius,</hi> as it appears by his Conduct at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> was a dextrous Perſon, which made no ſcruple to ſubſcribe to Terms which he did not like, provided he could expound them in a ſence agreeable to his mind, though little agreeable to that of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57945:82"/>thoſe who ſet them up. Indeed, a Man muſt ſhut his Eyes, who doth not ſee, by what he ſays in his Letter to the Church of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> that he underſtood otherwiſe the Terms of the <hi>Creed,</hi> than <hi>Athanaſius</hi> (for example) did. So that we ought not to mind the Terms which he uſes to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelf to ſuch ways of ſpeaking as were authorized, and which he look'd upon as equivocal; but only ſuch places wherein he ſpeaks after a manner altogether oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the received Opinions. In his Books <hi>De Theologia Eccleſiaſtica,</hi> he explains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſo great clearneſs in ſeveral places, that if ſome equivocal Paſſages may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them, there is ſcarce any Citation but what may be eluded. <q rend="margQuotes">You are afraid (ſays he to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> Book. 3. chap. 7.) leſt by owning Two Hypoſtaſes, you ſhould introduce Two Principles, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Unity of God.

He ſhews therefore,  1ſt. That the Chriſtians had very good Reaſons to renounce the Heatheniſh Religion, and gives ſome Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Theology of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and of the Opinions of the <hi>Graecians</hi> concerning the Beginning of the World, whereby it appears that all of them acknowledged that the World is not Eternal.  <hi>2dly.</hi> That the <hi>Graecians</hi> borrowed their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity from the Eaſtern Nations, and that their Gods were only Dead men, whoſe Graves were turned into Temples, and whoſe Fabulous Hiſtory was ſo ridiculous, that <hi>Plato</hi> laught at it.  <hi>3dly.</hi> That to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Fables, they have in vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained them after an Allegorical manner, a Method whereof he ſhews the Vanity.  <hi>4thly.</hi> That the Pagan Oracles contain only the Anſwers and Cheats of Bad <hi>Daemons. 5thly.</hi> That nothing was ſo falſe, as what the <hi>Stoicks</hi> ſaid concerning <hi>Fate. 6thly.</hi> That the Opinions and Cuſtoms of the ancient <hi>Hebrews</hi> were very agreeable to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

One may ſee by this whole Work, that he was very well vers'd in Heathen Authors, and had taken care, in his Study, to collect whatever might be of uſe to prove or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Chriſtian Religion by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Philoſophers.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57945:85"/>Old Teſtament, without being able to prove againſt thoſe who would have denied it, that they ought to be underſtood ſo. He lends, if I may ſo ſay, his Principles to the Prophets, and then fixes to their Terms the Idea's he had of them, by virtue of thoſe Principles. Thus <hi>Book</hi> 5. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. where he explains at large the famous Paſſage of <hi>Solomon</hi> concerning Wiſdom, <hi>God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten me before the Mountains;</hi> he finds in the word to <hi>Beget,</hi> all the Subtilties which the <hi>Arians</hi> uſed after the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to explain it according to their Mind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out openly ſhocking the Orthodox.</p>

As for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Nonna,</hi> ſhe was born of Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who had been careful of her Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and found her extremely enclined to Piety. Her Son doth alſo infinitely praiſe her Parts and Conduct.</p>
            <p>A Woman with ſuch Diſpoſitions could hardly allow that her Husband ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57945:91"/>the Errors of the <hi>Hypſiſtarians.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Gregory</hi> was a good-natur'd and temperate Man; ſo that tho' he had ſome erroneous Opinions, yet his Life was unblameable. <hi>Nonna</hi> was continually urging him to get himſelf inſtructed in the Chriſtian Religion; but he could not be perſuaded to't, till he had a Dream, which made him reſolve upon it. He dreamed that he was ſinging thoſe words of the Cxxii. <hi>Pſalm, I was glad when they ſaid unto me, We will go into the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> That way of Singing, though new, pleaſed him; and his Wife failed not to take hold of this Opportunity, to perſuade him to embrace Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>It happen'd at the very ſame time, that <hi>Leontius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> went that way with ſome other Biſhops, in his Journey to <hi>Nice,</hi> where <hi>Conſtanstine</hi> had called a Council. <hi>Gregory</hi> went to ſee him, and told him that he had a mind to turn Chriſtian. <hi>Leontius</hi> cauſed him to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; and whilſt they were inſtructing him, to admit him amongſt the <hi>Cathecumeni,</hi> he was upon his Knees, without being bid to riſe, whereas the <hi>Cathecumeni</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſtood whilſt they were inſtructed. Thoſe who were there, obſerved that Poſture, becauſe 'twas the Poſture of the Prieſts, when they were conſecrated. And his Son<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Orat.</hi> 19.</note> ſays, that every Body look'd upon
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57945:91"/>it as an <hi>Omen</hi> of his being ſome time or other honour'd with the Orders of a Prieſt. Afterwards, as the Biſhop of <hi>Nazianzum</hi> was baptiſing him, thoſe who ſtood by, ſaw him come out of the Water ſurrounded with Light, and the Biſhop could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſaying that <hi>Gregory</hi> ſhould ſucceed him in his Biſhoprick; as it happen'd, when the See of <hi>Nazianzum</hi> had been vacant for ſome time. His Son, who relates theſe two Circumſtances, ſtyles them <hi>Miracles:</hi> And becauſe then, as now-a-days, every body believed not whatever Church-men ſaid, he declares that he relates theſe Wonders only to the <hi>Faithful, becauſe none of thoſe great things appear true to profane Men.</hi> But a Man that is not profane, can't forbear ſuſpecting, not of want of Sincerity, but of Credulity and Exaggeration, thoſe <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical Souls</hi> who take Advantage of every thing. By relating Facts of that nature, when Men think that they ſay what they have ſeen, they often ſay what they have thought, concerning things at which they were ſurprized; and inſtead of the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable of their Eyes, they give out the doubtful Conſequences of a prejudiced Mind. They believe, without any Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, whatever is advantageous to the Party they have embraced; and whatever is contrary to it, is falſe, or at leaſt ſuſpected.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57945:92"/>Thoſe who will read <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> without making theſe Reflexions, will run the hazard either of looking upon him as a Man of little Sincerity, or of believing many unlikely Miracles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nonna</hi> had but one Daughter in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of her Marriage, if <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> whom <hi>Gregory</hi> her Brother mentions in ſeveral places, was the firſt Child ſhe had;<note n="*" place="margin">Greg. de Vita ſua, p. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> and ſhe did heartily deſire to have a Son. She made a Vow to God to conſecrate him to him, if he gave her one; and ſoon after ſhe had a Dream, in which ſhe ſaw the Face of the Son ſhe was to have, and learned what ſhould be his Name. Inſtead of one, ſhe had two; and as ſoon as they were born, ſhe took great care of their Education, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obſerved in them ſome Diſpoſitions which deſerved to be cultivated.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Gregory</hi> came to years, he was ſent to <hi>Caeſarea,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Greg. Presb. in Vit. Gr. p. <hi>4,</hi> &amp;c.</note> the Metropolis of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,</hi> where he was put under the beſt Maſters, to learn Humane Learning; that is to ſay, to underſtand the Greek Poets and Orators, and to write well in that Tongue. 'Twas the only thing that was minded in <hi>Aſia;</hi> and the reading of the Pagan Authors who had writ well in that Tongue, was the Study which they applied themſelves to. 'Tis thought that about that time <hi>Gregory</hi> became acquainted with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57945:92"/>
               <hi>Baſil,</hi> whoſe Friendſhip was ſo dear to him afterwards. From <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> he went afterwards<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Orat</hi>-10. <hi>p.</hi> 163.</note> to <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi> whereof <hi>Euſebius</hi> was Biſhop. He applied himſelf there<note n="†" place="margin">Hieron. de Script. Eccleſ. in Euzoio.</note> to Declaming, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom of that time, under a famous Rhetor named <hi>Theſpeſius.</hi> Having ſtay'd ſome time at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> he went to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which for ſome Centuries was much celebrated, by reaſon of the learned Men who were there. His ſtay there was not uſeleſs to him; but he did not think he could be accounted a learned Man, without going to <hi>Athens</hi> the Mother of Learning.</p>
            <p>Wherefore<note n="‖" place="margin">De Vita ſua, p. <hi>3, 4.</hi> Orat. <hi>19.</hi> p. <hi>306, 307.</hi>
               </note> he embarked on a Ship of the Iſland of <hi>Aegina,</hi> which is not far from the City of <hi>Athens.</hi> Foraſmuch as 'twas in the middle of <hi>November,</hi> he had not a very proſperous Paſſage. Being near the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> his Ship was toſſed with a violent Storm for ſeveral Days; and Proviſions failing, the trouble they were in was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Hunger; ſo that the Seamen would not have been able to do their Duty, had not a <hi>Phoenician</hi> Ship, which the Wind car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried towards them, afforded them ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays, that his greateſt grief at that time, was, that he was not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. That Thought affected him ſo much, that he moved the Seamen with Pity, though they were already afflicted
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57945:93"/>enough with the Peril they themſelves were in. He made a Vow to God, that he would get himſelf Baptized, and conſecrate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, and the Storm ceaſed ſome time after. It ſeems he was afraid of being damned, if he ſhould die without Baptiſm; and it being the Opinion of that time, 'tis a wonder that his Father and Mother, whoſe Piety he doth ſo much extoll, ſhould not take care that he ſhould be Baptized, from his very Childhood. 'Tis true, Baptiſm might be put off, leſt they ſhould fall off from Grace, which they thought God gave to thoſe who received it; or for fear they ſhould be Excommunicated, if they ſhould live after a manner unworthy of thoſe who were Baptized. But thoſe Fears don't take away the Difficulty; ſince Men are no leſs in danger of being damn'd if they live ill, without having received Baptiſm, than if they diſhonour it after they have received it. However, <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays that his Parents were warned of the Danger he was in, by a Dream which made 'em pray for him. One of thoſe who were in the ſame Ship ſaw alſo <hi>Nonna, Gregory</hi>'s Mother, walking upon the Sea, and drawing afterwards the Ship to the ſhore, and then the Storm ceaſed. They ſailed towards <hi>Greece,</hi> and having paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Rhodus,</hi> at laſt they arrived at the Iſle of <hi>Egina,</hi> from whence <hi>Gregory</hi> went to <hi>Athens.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="177" facs="tcp:57945:93"/>
            <p>He had not been there long, before<note n="*" place="margin">Orat. <hi>20.</hi> p. <hi>326.</hi> Vid. &amp; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad. ap. Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium. Ced. <hi>lxxx.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Baſil</hi> came to it. Then the Friendſhip which they had begun to contract at <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea,</hi> did very much encreaſe. Foraſmuch as they applied themſelves to the ſame Study, and had the ſame Inclinations, they grew ſo intimate Friends, that <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays they were but <hi>One Soul in Two Bodies.</hi> We ſhall ſee afterwards what altered that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The <hi>Sophiſts,</hi> or Maſters of Rhetorick, who lived at <hi>Athens,</hi> had every one of them their Faction, and endeavoured by all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable means to get Diſciples. In order to it, they kept ſome of their Party in all the Avenues of the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> and as ſoon as they ſaw ſome Young Men who came to ſtudy there, thoſe who happen'd to be the ſtrongeſt, ſeized them, and then lodged them at their Friends. Thoſe who who were able to bring many Diſciples to their Maſter, paid nothing to him; which made the poor Scholars watchful to obſerve the Strangers who came to <hi>Athens.</hi> A Young Man being thus got into their hands, ſome among the Scholars put ſome Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to him, and delighted to contradict him, to know whether he had any Wit. Afterwards, they conducted him in a ſolemn manner to the Publick Baths; and thoſe who had taken him, went before him two and two. When he came to the Door,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57945:94"/>they made as if they were not willing that he ſhould go in, and made a great noiſe to fright him: yet they ſoon after let him go in; and when he had waſhed himſelf, they they put the <hi>Philoſophical Cloak</hi> upon his Shoulders, which before he was not allowed to wear. <hi>Baſil</hi> was exempted from that Ceremony, becauſe he had made much greater progreſſes than thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly came to <hi>Athens</hi> to ſtudy there; but it doth not appear that <hi>Gregory,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates that, had a like Privilege. I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that Cuſtom, though not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in it ſelf; becauſe one may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by apprehend how much in love they were then with the <hi>Sophiſtical</hi> Art, or Rhetorick, and how greedy the Maſters were of getting Diſciples. One may alſo perceive thereby, that the Academies of thoſe times were not better regulated than thoſe of our time; and that in all likelyhood when the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents left 'em, they were not more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved than they are now.</p>
            <p>The two greateſts Sophiſts that were then at <hi>Athens,</hi> were <hi>Himerius</hi> and <hi>Proereſius,</hi> who both were very much eſteem'd by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Julian.</hi> The latter being<note n="*" place="margin">Eunap. Sard. in Vita Proae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note> an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi> by Birth, had for that reaſon in his School all the Youth of <hi>Pontus, Cappadocia, Bithynia.</hi> and the other Provinces in the neighbourhood of this Country. Which
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57945:94"/>makes one believe that <hi>Gregory</hi> ſtudied at <hi>Athens</hi> under him. The ſame Sophiſt was ſo much eſteem'd, that the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans</hi> treated him at his own Table, and ſent him to <hi>Rome</hi> with a magnificent Train, where they erected a Statue to him, with this Inſcription upon the Pedeſtal, <hi>ROME</hi> THE QUEEN OF CITIES, TO THE KING OF ELOQUENCE.</p>

But he ſoon after perceived that the <hi>Armenians</hi> acted out of Envy, which made him ſide with <hi>Baſil,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put his Adverſaries to flight. From that time their Friendſhip took deeper root, and they lived very amicably together. Had it not been for the lucky meeting of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57945:95"/>ſuch a Friend as <hi>Gregory, Baſil</hi> would have been weary of <hi>Athens,</hi> where he found not the Learning he hoped to find in it; but <hi>Gregory</hi> comforted him with his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gave him to underſtand, that it required ſome time to know throughly all the learned Men of a City, and to be able to judge of them without raſhneſs. Both of them applied themſelves to the wiſeſt and moſt rational of thoſe who ſtudied at <hi>Athens,</hi> not to thoſe who made the greateſt figure, and diſputed beſt. <hi>Baſil</hi> left that City firſt, from whence he undertook ſome Travels, and at laſt retired to <hi>Caeſarea. Gregory,</hi> ſome time after, returned to <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,</hi> to aſſiſt and comfort his Father and Mother in their Old Age. He deſcribes,<note n="*" place="margin">De Vita ſua, p. <hi>4.</hi> &amp; alibi.</note> in more than one place, in a very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der manner, a Separation which coſt him many Tears; whereby one may know that <hi>Gregory</hi> was very tender of, and heartily loved his Friends.</p>

From that time <hi>Gregory</hi> began to hope no good thing from him, (as I ſhall obſerve, when I come to the Orations he made againſt him.) After <hi>Baſil</hi>'s departure, he applied himſelf eſpecially to Eloquence, and Declamed with ſo much Applauſe, that every body look'd upon him as one of the chief Orators of that time. He was not naturally enclined, as he himſelf ſays, to that ſort of life; and he ſoon after made his eſcape from <hi>Athens,</hi> where he had been detained, as it were, againſt his will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking his leave of any Body.<note n="†" place="margin">De Vita ſua, p. <hi>5, 6.</hi> &amp; Orat. <hi>x.</hi> p. <hi>165.</hi>
               </note> He loved naturally a quiet life, which made him averſe to any manner of life that would have made him too buſie. Thoſe who live after that manner, and perform well their Employments, ſeemed to him to be only uſeful to others; and thoſe who live alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a retreat, ſeem'd to him to be only good for themſelves.

            <p>He departed from <hi>Athens</hi> full of thoſe thoughts, and went to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by Land. He found there his Brother <hi>Caeſarius,</hi> who came thither by Sea, at his return from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he had ſtudied Phyſick.<note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> made a Confeſſion of Faith, in which ſuppoſing that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural Term was to be uſed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the word <hi>Conſubſtantial</hi> ought not to be uſed, they only ſaid, <hi>that the Son was like the Father, according to the Apoſtle, who ſays, That the Son is the Image of the Inviſible God.</hi> Thoſe who ſaid that the Son was not like the Father, were alſo condemned in it. <hi>Acacius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> drew up that Confeſſion of Faith.

               </note> They only added to it, that in this matter, the words <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis</hi> ought not to be uſed; becauſe thoſe words which had cauſed ſo many Diſputes, were not to be found in the Holy Scripture. In the mean time, the <hi>Arians</hi> being urged by the Orthodox to ſay in what that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of the Father did conſiſt, made it to conſiſt only in the Will: Whereas the others maintained, That the Subſtance of the Son, though diſtinct, was altogether like the Subſtance of the Father. But foraſmuch as equivocal Terms were uſed by both Parties, it gave occaſion to thoſe who were not skill'd in thoſe Subtilties, to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57945:97"/>equivocate, and confound two very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Opinions. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Father was one of thoſe who fell into that Snare;<note n="*" place="margin">Orat. <hi>xix.</hi> p. <hi>297.</hi> &amp; Vit. Greg. p. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note> he ſubſcribed to the Confeſſions of Faith of <hi>Seleucia</hi> and <hi>Ariminum:</hi> The miraculous Light which appeared at his Baptiſm, and his Study ſince that time, had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened his Mind to ſuch a degree, as to make him underſtand the <hi>Arian</hi> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. That Action of the Biſhop of of <hi>Nazianzum</hi> allarm'd the Monks of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,</hi> who being full of Zeal for the <hi>Conſubſtantiality,</hi> refuſed to Communicate with the good Man, and got part of the People on their ſide. 'Tis likely that his Son <hi>Gregory</hi> was not then at <hi>Nazianzum;</hi> for he would have hindred his Father from committing a Fault, which he obliged him to acknowledge by a publick Recantation.</p>
            <p>Having thus appeaſed the Monks, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Son got into the Pulpit, and made the Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Peace,</hi> which is his XII. <hi>Oration,</hi> in the preſence of his Father, who was not to be compared to him for Eloquence and Learning.  1. He ſays, That the pleaſure he had to ſee Peace reſtored to the Church of <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> had induced him to make that Diſcourſe, whereas before nothing could perſuade him to ſpeak.  2. That he had been extremely moved at the Diviſion which had before happened;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57945:98"/>eſpecially conſidering the auſtere and holy Life of the Monks, which he deſcribes by the bye, with great Rhetorical Exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.  3. That Diviſions are the cauſe of all ſorts of Miſchiefs; and that they had reaſon to thank God, becauſe that which aroſe in the Church of <hi>Nazianzum</hi> was over.  4. That the Church of <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> which before that laſt Diviſion, knew not what Schiſm was, ought to endeavour for the future to enjoy a perpetual Peace.  5. That in the laſt Diſcord. Men were ſo fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that the Biſhop of <hi>Nazianzum</hi> acted ſincerely, and kept the Truth of the Faith, that they upbraided him only with his being impoſed upon by equivocal Words.  6. That every thing invites us to Peace; God, Angels, and all Creatures which are maintained by Concord.  7. That the <hi>Jews</hi> had been happy whilſt they were at Peace one with another, but became unfortunate as ſoon as they were divided.  8. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that all manner of Peace ought not to be ſought after, but that a <hi>medium</hi> ought to be kept; and that 'tis one's Duty to oppoſe Hereſie with all one's might, when any body prefeſſes it openly; but that one ought to forbear making a Schiſm upon meer Suſpicions. <q rend="margQuotes">

His Reaſonings ſeem too far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetch'd, and are not very convincing; as when he ſays, That <hi>the World is preſerved by Peace:</hi> That's a far-fetch'd Thought; and the contrary might be ſaid, as indeed ſome Philoſophers have aſſerted, That the Oppoſition which is between the ſeveral Parts of the Univerſe, keeps them in the ſtate they are in, becauſe they hinder one another from leaving it.  3dly.

               <hi>Julian</hi> being come to the Throne, in the Year 361, ſought for all manner of ways to ruine the Chriſtians; and perceiving that they made a great uſe of the Pagan Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, either to fit themſelves for Eloquence, or to take from them ſome Reaſons fit to defend the Chriſtian Religion, and attack Paganiſm, he undertook to hinder the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from applying themſelves to the ſtudy of Humane Learning.

               </note> Modern Author judiciouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, foraſmuch as he ſpeaks there more like an Orator than an Hiſtorian, tis a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing to find out what he means. 'Tis an ill effect of the continual Rhetorick of moſt of the Antients: They are ſo Eloquent, that they can't be underſtood. 'Tis likely that <hi>Julian</hi> did not forbid the Children of Chriſtians to go to the Schools of Pagan Teachers, either becauſe he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſays ſo, or becauſe it was a good way to ſeduce 'em. Hence it is, that ſome learned Men amongſt the Chriſtians, as both <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linaris</hi>'s and <hi>Gregory,</hi> put the Scripture and Doctrines of Religion in Greek Verſes, or fine Proſe. Thoſe Writings might ſupply the room of thoſe of the Ancient Pagans, and the Youth needed no Grammarians to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57945:102"/>underſtand 'em. Parents might eaſily be inſtead of Tutors to their Children, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain thoſe Chriſtian Verſes to them, after they had read the Holy Scripture. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that Prohibition made the Chriſtians very angry, who could not abide that their Grammarians, Rhetors and Philoſophers ſhould have been ſent back <hi>to the Churches of the Galileans</hi> (theſe are <hi>Julian</hi>'s words) <hi>to explain there</hi> Matthew <hi>and</hi> Luke. Had they never done any thing elſe, they would not have introduced ſo many new words, nor handled the Doctrines then in queſtion with ſo many Subtilties, nor would the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick</hi> Philoſophy have had ſo great a ſhare in their Deciſions.</p>
            <p>About that time, <hi>Caeſarius, Gregory</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was returned (as hath been ſaid) to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was made <hi>Julian</hi>'s Chief Phyſician; and becauſe of his Learning, he was admitted into the number of the Friends of that Emperor, who loved learned Men. Whereupon <hi>Gregory</hi> wrote to him a very ſharp<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep.</hi> xvii.</note> Letter, wherein he tells him, That he had made all his Family aſhamed, by reaſon of his Conduct; That every body wonder'd that a Biſhop's Son ſhould follow the Court, and endeavour to get Honours and Riches among the Pagans; That he made his Father's Life unpleaſant to him, who could not blame in others what his Son
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57945:103"/>did; That they were obliged to conceal his Conduct from his Mother, leſt ſhe ſhould die with Grief; That he had enough to live handſomly, without expoſing himſelf to ſo great danger. Laſtly, That if he went on in the ſame manner of life, he muſt be rank't among thoſe Chriſtians who leaſt deſerve that Name. If <hi>Caeſarius</hi> was not perſuaded by that Letter to return to his Parents, 'tis likely however that it ſtrengthened him againſt <hi>Julian</hi>'s Endeavours to induce him to renounce Chriſtianity, which his Brother mentions in<note n="*" place="margin">

O <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren!

            <p>At that time <hi>Gregory</hi> compoſed his two Invectives againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> wherein he omits nothing that can make him odious to all Poſterity.

But every body, if we believe <hi>Gregory,</hi> affirmed, that, as they intended to force their entrance into that Temple, ſome Flames came out of it, which conſumed part of them, and lamed the reſt. If any miraculous thing happen'd on this occaſion, it muſt be confeſt, that they took little care to write it faithfully; ſince Hiſtory varies ſo much about it, as one may ſee by comparing only <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> with <hi>Gregory.</hi> However, the latter ſpeaks very poſitively of that Fire, which came out of the Foundations, or out of the Temple; and to convince altogether Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, he adds, <q rend="margQuotes">Let no body refuſe to believe thoſe Miracles, unleſs he rejects the other Miracles of God too.

            <p>To return to our Hiſtory, <hi>Gregory</hi> having been ordained a Prieſt againſt his Will, as hath been already ſaid, reſolved to retire into the ſolitary places of <hi>Pontus,</hi> without his Father's leave.

'Tis a hard matter to know whether he pronounced that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, or was contented to write it down; but he recited before the People the Forty firſt <hi>Oration,</hi> which runs upon the ſame Subject.

            <p>Another Difficulty which attended the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Epiſcopacy, conſiſted in diſcourſing well of the Myſteries of Chriſtianity, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of the<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>It ſeems that <hi>Gregory</hi> had not been long his Father's Coadjutor, when his Brother <hi>Caeſarius</hi> died. 'Twas not long after the Earthquake which happen'd in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> in <hi>October,</hi> in the Year 368. He was then at<note n="*" place="margin">

               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:57945:121"/>arrived there; and the Maſters of the Ships <hi>Hammon, Aphammon, Harpocras, Steppas, Rhodon, Anubis</hi> and <hi>Hermanubis,</hi> joined preſently with <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Aſſembly, though they had Orders to favour the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of <hi>Maximus,</hi> whom two or three <hi>Egyptian</hi> Biſhops deſigned to uphold more vigorouſly afterwards. In the mean time, the arrival of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the care they took to join with <hi>Gregory,</hi> rejoyced him ſo much, that he made<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Orat.</hi> 24.</note> an <hi>Oration</hi> thereupon, wherein he doth very much extoll the Piety and Conſtancy of thoſe of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and explains to them his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning the Equality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He doth eſpecially enlarge to prove the Divinity of the Holy Spirit; and among other Reaſons, he uſes this Argument, the Terms whereof would ſeem ſtrange, had I not already obſerved the like before:<note n="†" place="margin">

               <hi>If the Holy Spirit is not God, let him be made God first, and then let him make me God equal to him in Honour.</hi> The meaning of that harſh Expreſſion ſeems only to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> that if the Holy Spirit is not God, he cannot ſanctifie Men, which <hi>Gregory</hi> ſtyles elſewhere, <hi>to make Men Gods.</hi>

            <p>Some learned Men conjecture that about the ſame time <hi>Gregory</hi> made the Panegyrick of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> which is his One and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth <hi>Oration.</hi> He diſplays in it not only

            </p>
            <p>To return<note n="*" place="margin">Carm. de Vit. p. <hi>14,</hi> &amp;c.</note> to <hi>Maximus,</hi> his Party grew ſtronger, by the arrival of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in the Year 379; and the better to engage the Biſhops of that Country to ſerve him, he ſent to them conſiderable Preſents. Wherefore, he borrowed ſome Money of a Prieſt who was lately come from <hi>Thaſſus,</hi> an Iſland of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> with Orders to buy at <hi>Conſtantinnple</hi> ſome Marble, and other Materials for a Church, which they deſign'd to build in that Iſland. Not long after that, <hi>Gregory</hi> being indiſpoſed, went
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57945:123"/>out of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to take the Air, and ſo gave occaſion to the Biſhops to go very early to his Church, and to place <hi>Maximus</hi> upon the Epiſcopal See. They could not make an end of the Ceremony of that <hi>Cynicks</hi> Ordination, before it was noiſed about in the City. Whereupon the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Clergy, and the People, without excepting the <hi>Arians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, went in a Crowd to the <hi>Anaſtaſis,</hi> and turned thoſe Biſhops out of the Church. They retired into a Play-houſe that was hard by, where they cut his Hair, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated him. Which did but exaſperate the People, who gave <hi>Maximus</hi> all ſort of ill Language, and blamed <hi>Gregory</hi> for having too kindly received that wicked Man into his Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> having notice of what paſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned preſently to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and made that <hi>Oration,</hi> which is the Twenty-eighth in order; wherein he ſays, that he was gone out of Town with ſome repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, and that the little time he had been abſent, had but encreaſed his Love for his Flock. He doth again ſhew the Perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Maximus,</hi> and thoſe of his Party; to which he adds a Deſcription of a true Chriſtian Philoſopher. He excuſes himſelf for his having been deceived by <hi>Maximus;</hi> becauſe Good Men being not Suſpicious, he
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57945:123"/>could not ſuſpect that that Philoſopher would deceive him. Laſtly, He ſays, that he is ready to leave the Epiſcopal See, and that he never deſired it. He mixes ſeveral general Reflexions in that Diſcourſe, and ſeems to prepare himſelf to Patience, by the Conſideration of the Miſeries of this Life. It appears that he was an Old Man, becauſe he ſays that <hi>Maximus</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 483.</note> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>upbraid him with his Old Age, and want of Health;</hi> which is contrary to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of thoſe who believe that <hi>Gregory</hi> was born about the time of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Return got him the People on his ſide, and obliged <hi>Maximus</hi> to leave the City, but not to give over his Deſign. It ſeems that he wrote to the<note n="†" place="margin">Ep. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſ. &amp; Epp. Italiae ad Theod. Imp. Conc. T. <hi>2.</hi> col. <hi>1007.</hi>
               </note> Biſhops of the <hi>Italick Dioceſs,</hi> met in a Synod at <hi>Aquileia,</hi> to whom he imparted the News of his Election, which had been approved by the Communicatory Letters of <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which he ſent to them, to be read in their Council. He confeſt he had been Ordained in a Private Houſe; but he ſaid it was becauſe the <hi>Arians</hi> had ſeized all the Churches, and that he was forced to give way to their Violence. The Council, who knew not the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, approved his Ordination, thinking that <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Promotion was not according
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57945:124"/>to the Canons; becauſe a Biſhop was not allowed to leave one Church, and ſettle himſelf in another. Their Approbation of <hi>Maximus</hi>'s Ordination was alſo the reaſon why they refuſed ſince to Communicate with <hi>Nectarius</hi> his Succeſſor, and wrote to the Emperor to deſire him to have an eye to it, and to reſtore <hi>Maximus;</hi> or to call a General Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> to examine that Buſineſs. <hi>Damaſus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paoved alſo <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Election, who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Canons, ſhould have ſtay'd at <hi>Saſime,</hi> ſince it was not lawful for a Biſhop<note n="*" place="margin">In Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. Rom. Holſten. p. <hi>37.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>to leave the People committed to his Charge, to remove to another out of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which breeds Quarrels and Schiſms.</hi> Thus he ſpeaks of it in a Letter written to ſome Biſhops of <hi>Egypt,</hi> wherein he alſo blames <hi>Mavimus</hi>'s Election, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Canons. He wrote<note n="†" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 43.</note> further to <hi>Acholius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> againſt the ſame, and exhorted him to endeavour to get a Catholick Biſhop eſtabliſhed at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> It appears from thence, that <hi>Gregory</hi>'s leaving <hi>Saſime,</hi> had offended ſeveral People; and perhaps he was ſomewhat too Nice, for one who was ſo little addicted to the World, as he himſelf ſays he was. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, his reſolving to go to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> after he had deſpiſed <hi>Saſime,</hi> was a thing that might raiſe Suſpicions in the Mind of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57945:124"/>ill-affected Perſons. 'Tis not to be doubted but <hi>Maximus</hi> did maliciouſly make uſe of all that, to ruine <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Reputation; and this perhaps emboldened him to go to <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> to deſire <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to reſtore him by an Edict. But he was ſo far from obtaining what he deſired, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ordered him with Threatnings to give over his Purſuits. Being enraged at his having miſſed his aim, he went to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria;</hi> where having drawn ſome People to his Party, he threatned <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of that City to deprive him of his Place, if he he did not help him to invade the Biſhoprick of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Governor of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> having had notice of this Inſolence, and being afraid that the <hi>Cynick</hi> would cauſe ſome Diſturbance, baniſh'd him out of the City; and Hiſtory doth not tell us what became of him afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> being thus got rid of <hi>Maximus,</hi> was now expoſed to the <hi>Arian</hi> Faction, which endeavoured to cry him down, by ridiculing his Countrey and Relations. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they accuſed him of ill Humour, Careleſneſs, and other like Defects. But becauſe thoſe Reproaches were either ill grounded, or inconſiderable, he eaſily juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf, as may be ſeen in his Twenty-fifth <hi>Oration.</hi> That which did him the greateſt Prejudice, is, that though he was
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57945:125"/>great Orator, according to the manner of the Age he lived in, yet he was not really fit to do a thouſand other things neceſſary to maintain himſelf againſt the <hi>Arians.</hi> He ſhould have made his Intereſt at Court, and got the Favour of the Grandee's, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Intereſt of his Church: But this he was not capable of, having ſpent the greateſt part of his Life in Study and Quiet. Hence it is that that Prieſt, who had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured <hi>Maximus</hi> (as I have ſaid) drew ſeveral Catholicks to himſelf, who began to ſay that <hi>Gregory</hi> was not capable of well performing the Epiſcopal Duties; which required no leſs Experience and Skill in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, than Eloquence and Learning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> was ſo weary of the Complaints and Croſſes of thoſe Men, that one day<note n="*" place="margin">De Vita ſua, p. <hi>17, 18.</hi>
               </note> he undertook to take his leave of his People. But he had no ſooner ſaid that he would go, than that the whole Aſſembly did ſo earneſtly deſire him not to leave them, and not to ſuffer the Orthodox Doctrine to periſh by the <hi>Arians</hi> Endeavours, after his departure; that at laſt he was perſuaded to ſtay till the Eaſtern Biſhops, who were to meet ſhortly, as 'twas reported, would chuſe another to fill up the Epiſcopal See of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the ſtate of Affairs, until the arrival of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinple,</hi> the

            <p>The Emperor having ſent for <hi>Gregory,</hi> received him very kindly, and told him he was going to put him in poſſeſſion of the Cathedral of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Leſt the People, the greateſt part whereof followed the Opinions of <hi>Arius,</hi> ſhould riſe up, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> ſent ſome Soldiers to ſeize the <hi>Church of the Apoſtles;</hi> and ſent <hi>Gregory</hi> to it, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſome others, through the midſt of the People, who cried on every ſide, and were as much afflicted as if <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> had been taken; which could not be a pleaſant Spectacle to a wiſe and moderate Biſhop. Though the Sun was up, it was ſo clouded, that one would have thought it was Night; but the Sun ſhone all of a ſudden, when <hi>Gregory</hi> came to Church. That Circumſtance ſhould not deſerve to be taken notice of, were it not that our Biſhop relates it as an extraordinary
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57945:126"/>thing; having ſaid, <q rend="margQuotes">

                  </note> That though he is one of thoſe who are moſt oppoſite to ſuch Thoughts; yet he believes 'tis better to believe all things, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to believe what is ſaid.</q> — As ſoon as they came to Church, all the People that were in it, cried out, they would have <hi>Gregory</hi> to be their Biſhop. He ſilenced them, getting a Prieſt to tell them, that they ought not to cry, but to give Thanks to God. As for the reſt, he was threatned with no danger, except that one Man only drew his Sword, which he preſently put up into its Scabboard.</p>
            <p>But though the <hi>Arians</hi> had yielded their Churches, yet they murmured about it among themſelves, and were angry becauſe they had been turned out. <hi>Gregory</hi> believed, with great reaſon, that the Heterodox might be wrought upon by Mildneſs, which he more willingly uſed than the Emperor's Authority.

            </p>

               </note> though the others were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly there, to be in the Emperor's or his Officers Favour; and made uſe of Piety, as a pretence to raiſe themſelves, and ruine their Enemies. Foraſmuch as he was Old, and of a Weak Conſtitution, he was often indiſpoſed; which his Enemies aſcribed to too great a Delicacy. As he was once in his Bed, they ſent a Man to kill him; who moved with repentance, confeſt to him, at the feet of his Bed, that they had incited him to commit that Crime; the Pardon of which he preſently obtained.</p>
            <p>As for the Revenues of the Church, <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays, that having not been able to find any Account of them, neither among the Papers of thoſe who had been Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> before him, nor among thoſe to whom the care of gathering them was committed; he would not meddle with them, and took nothing out of them, to avoid giving an account of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> called at that time a Council at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> either to condemn ſeveral Hereſies, or to ſettle <hi>Gregory</hi> Canonically in the Epiſcopal See of that City.

I have a common Anſwer to both, and another which concerns only the latter: I ask therefore the latter, why they call us <hi>Tritheiſts,</hi> ſince they honour the Son; and whether, though they leave out the Holy Spirit, they are not <hi>Ditheiſts?</hi> How d'ye explain your <hi>Ditheiſm,</hi> when they offer you this Objection?

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57945:132"/>a Diſpute with thoſe two ſorts of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and a common Anſwer to both. We have but One God, becauſe there is but One Godhead; and that thoſe who emaned from it, refer to One only thing, though we believe Three of them. The one is not more God than the other; the one is not Anterior, and the other Poſterior. They are not divided in Will, nor ſeparate in Power, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them that is found in things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; but to ſay all in a word, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is without Diviſion in Three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Perſons; as in Three Suns faſtened one to another, there would be but One Mixture of Light. When we conſider the Deity, and the Firſt Cauſe of the Monarchy, we conceive but One Thing; but when we conſider thoſe in whom the Deity, and thoſe who emaned from the Firſt Cauſe before Time was, and enjoy the ſame Glory, we worſhip Three.</q>

            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">But it will be ſaid, <hi>Is there not One only Deity among the Pagans, as their most learned Philoſophers ſay?

               <hi>(as the Son and the Holy Spirit are other Minds diſtinct from the Father,)</hi> but ſome Emanations <q rend="margQuotes">and Eſſential Properties of the Sun. Laſtly, <hi>Gregory</hi>

            <p>One may judge from thoſe places, of the Doctrine of <hi>Gregory,</hi> and the <hi>Orthodox</hi> of his time; with whom the <hi>Orthodox</hi> of ours agree as well in Terms, as they differ from them in Sence.

            <p>Such a Conduct, was the Cauſe of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by degrees from the ancient Notions; becauſe the word <hi>

            <p>Having thus alledged ſo many Proofs of our Biſhops Opinion concerning the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which then divided Chriſtians, 'tis now time to return to his Hiſtory.

               </note> they declared <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> though he endeavoured to be excuſed from it. They made him promiſe he would ſtay in it; becauſe he perſuaded himſelf, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Station, he could more eaſily reconcile the different Parties which divided Chriſtianity.

               </note> 
               <hi>Antioch</hi> replied to that, That the Deſign of that Canon was to bridle Pride and Ambition, which had no ſhare in that Buſineſs. Beſides, it ſeems, that that Canon was not obſerved in the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> ſince<note n="†" place="margin">Carm. de Vit. ſua, p. <hi>29.</hi>

            <p>That Buſineſs being over, they came to treat of the chief Subject for which they were met; <hi>viz. Macedonius</hi>'s Opinion, who had been Biſhop of <hi>Gonſtantinople,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the Holy Spirit is but a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; though all the Diſciples of that Biſhop agreed not about the Nature of that Divine Perſon, (as may be ſeen from a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Gregory,</hi> which I have quoted.)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> was preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the Council, and 'twas thought fit<note n="‖" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>The Council did alſo Anathematize the Opinions of <hi>Sabellius, Marcellus, Photinus,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57945:136"/>Eunomius, Apollinaris,</hi> and <hi>Macedonius;</hi> but I ſhall not enlarge upon thoſe Errors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no eſſential relation with the Life of <hi>Gregory.</hi> For the ſame reaſon, I ſhall omit what concerns the Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>All things went quietly enough with reſpect to <hi>Gregory,</hi> till there aroſe a Storm, which deprived him of the Epiſcopal See of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when he leaſt expected it. The Spirit of Vengeance, of a Party which he oppoſed, was the cauſe of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance; which <hi>Gregory,</hi> who was not courageous enough to ſuſtain the ſhock of his Adverſaries, could not get himſelf rid of, but by running away.</p>
            <p>There happen'd, ſome time before, a miſchievous Schiſm in the Church of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> where there were Two Orthodox Biſhops at the ſame time. <hi>Meletius</hi> being dead at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> before the Council was ended, 'twas propoſed to give him a Succeſſor. Thereupon <hi>Gregory</hi> propoſed an Expedient to put an end to that Schiſm; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Paulinus,</hi> who was the other Orthodox Biſhop,<note n="*" place="margin">Carm. de Vit. p. <hi>25.</hi>
               </note> and had been Ordained by <hi>Lucifer</hi> of <hi>Cagliari,</hi> ſhould govern alone the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> during the reſt of his life; and afterwards, thoſe of <hi>Melelius</hi>'s Party being reunited with thoſe of <hi>Paulinus</hi>'s, ſhould chuſe a Biſhop by common Votes.</p>
            <pb n="263" facs="tcp:57945:136"/>
            <p>Leſt it ſhould be thought he had ſome Intereſt in favouring <hi>Paulinus,</hi> and that he deſigned to make a Party; he offered the Counſel to leave the Epiſcopal Throne of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> on which he was juſt ſetled. But the <hi>Ambitious</hi> Men, and <hi>Incendiaries,</hi> (as <hi>Gregory</hi> calls 'em) who began to move to give a Succeſſor to <hi>Meletius,</hi> would not hearken to that Propoſal.<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. <hi>p.</hi> 27.</note> A company of Young Men fell a crying like <hi>Mag-pies,</hi> and made ſo great a Noiſe, that they drew in even the Old Biſhops, who ſhould have reſiſted them, and brought to a ſecond Examination the Buſineſs of <hi>Gregory,</hi> which was juſt before ended. <hi>Gregory</hi> deſcribes admirably well their Ambition, Ignorance, and their other Defects, in the <hi>Poem</hi> he made concerning his Life: One had better read it in the Author himſelf, than here. In the mean time, the People having heard that <hi>Gregory</hi> began to be weary of the Council, and was talking of retiring, fell a crying that they would not take their Paſtor from them, and deſired him that he would not leave his Flock.</p>
            <p>Thereupon, <hi>Timothy</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> who had ſucceeded <hi>Peter,</hi> and was of a violent and quarrelſom Temper, arrived with ſeveral <hi>Egyptian</hi> Biſhops. The old Grudge they bore <hi>Gregory,</hi> on the account of <hi>Maximus</hi> the <hi>Cynick,</hi> had inflam'd them
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57945:137"/>to ſuch a degree againſt our Biſhop, that the firſt thing they did, was to complain that they had broke the Canons, by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring <hi>Gregory</hi> from one Biſhoprick to another. This cauſed a great ſtir in the Council, and on that occaſion <hi>Gregory</hi> made his <hi>Oration</hi> concerning <hi>Peace,</hi> which is the Fourteenth, wherein he deſcribes at large the Advantages of Concord, and the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which ariſe from Diviſions. He ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cenſures the Inconſtancy of the Biſhops, who had other Thoughts of him, without any reaſon, and ſuffered themſelves to be impoſed upon by the Calumnies of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. He ſays, that the ill Reports which are commonly ſpread againſt Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men, ought to be deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, One may eaſily perceive, by all that he ſays, that 'tis not only in our time that Men have cover'd their moſt ſhameful Paſſions, with the ſpecious Name of Zeal for the Purity of the Faith. Wherefore <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> ſays<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. <hi>p</hi> 29.</note> that he told 'em, <q rend="margQuotes">That they ſhould not trouble themſelves ſo much with what concerned him, but that they ſhould endeavour to be re-united; That 'twas time for 'em to expoſe themſelves no longer to be laught at as Wild Men, and ſuch as have learned nothing but Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling; That provided they would agree, he would willingly be the <hi>Jonas</hi> who ſhould
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57945:137"/>make the Storm to ceaſe; That he had accepted of the Epiſcopal See againſt his will, and willingly parted with it; and that his Body, weakened with Old Age, obliged him to't.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe notwithſtanding they charged him with Ambition ſtill, he made a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which is his Twenty ſeventh <hi>Oration;</hi> whereby he proteſts that he had accepted the Biſhoprick of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt his will, and appeals to all the People for it. He ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ortt.</hi> 27. <hi>p.</hi> 465.</note> he doth not know whether he ought to call the See of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the <hi>Throne of a Tyrant,</hi> or a <hi>Biſhop:</hi> He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of his Enemies Evil-ſpeaking, and the Envy they bore him,<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 466.</note> becauſe of his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and Learning in the Sciences of the Pagans. That perhaps raiſed the Envy of ſome; but the Station he was in, raiſed without doubt the Envy of many more. He might have made uſe of all his Rhetorick at <hi>Saſime,</hi> without being put to any trouble upon that account.</p>
            <p>Having declared, a Full Council, that he deſired to leave the Place, which was ſo much envied; he went to the Emperor's Palace, to deſire him to give him leave to retire. He obtained it with ſome difficulty; and having obtained it, his only Thoughts were to take his leave publickly; which he did in the Cathedral, in the preſence
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57945:138"/>of a Hundred and Fifty Biſhops, and all the People. The Diſcourſe he made is extant ſtill, and is the Thirty ſecond in order. He deſcribes the bad Condition he found the Orthodox Church of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in, and the Alteration he made in it: He makes a Confeſſion of his Belief concerning the Holy Trinity, and ſhews that he had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that deſerved to be cenſured: He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the Fathers of the Council to chuſe a Perſon worthy of the See of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to ſucceed him; and laſtly, takes his leave of all thoſe who heard him. In that<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 523.</note> 
               <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> he complains of his Old Age. And in the <hi>Poem</hi> concerning his <hi>Life,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 30.</note> he ſays he was then but <hi>a Dead Man Animated:</hi> Which he could not ſay, had he been but Fifty ſix, or Fifty ſeven years old, according to the ordinary Supputation.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he had taken his leave, the People, and generally all thoſe who heard him at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſhewed a great grief for it. The Conduct of the Council muſt needs have appeared to them very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and violent, ſince after they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <hi>Gregory</hi> in the See of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> they obliged him to leave it, when he was above Fourſcore Years old. Without doubt, ſo imprudent and Unchriſtian a Behaviour gave matter of Sport to the Enemies of the Council, and leſſen'd in a great meaſure
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57945:138"/>the Authority of their Deciſions. For how can it be imagined that Biſhops, as Factious, Unjuſt and Ignorant as <hi>Gregory</hi> deſcribes them in ſeveral Places, were able to examine with Deliberation the Doctrines then in queſtion? If their Intereſt made 'em not encline to Orthodoxy, 'twas a meer Chance which led them into the right way. The love of Truth is ſeldom to be found with ſo much Vanity and Ignorance.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Gregory</hi> left the Biſhoprick of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> ſome Weeks after he had been ſetled in it by the Council that turned him out of it: He retired into <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Gregory</hi> the Prieſt, the Author of his <hi>Life,</hi>) and went to live at <hi>Arianzum,</hi> where he was born.</p>
            <p>Among thoſe who were preſented to the Emperor, ſome Biſhops<note n="*" place="margin">Sozom. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> put in <hi>Nectarius</hi> a Senator of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> a Man of an Exemplary Life, and good Mien, but was not Baptized yet, and had ſcarce any Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 'Tis not known whether <hi>Gregory</hi> ſet out for <hi>Cappadocia</hi> before that Election was made, or whether he ſtay'd at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> till they had named him a Succeſſor. However, <hi>Gregory</hi> wrote<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Orat.</hi> 46.</note> an Inſtruction for <hi>Nectarius,</hi> wherein he begins with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q rend="margQuotes">That it ſeems, God's Providence, which heretofore took care of the Churches, had altogether given over the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57945:139"/>Conduct of the Things of this Life.</q> — He ſays, that his Private Afflictions, though ſo great, that they would ſeem intollerable to any body elſe, induced him not to ſpeak ſo: He aſſures, that the Condition only the Church was in, extorted thoſe words from him. Afterwards, he deſcribes to <hi>Nectarius</hi> the Boldneſs of the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who were at leaſt as numerous as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and dared to meet publickly. A horrible Undertaking, after the Deciſions of a Council ſo well regulated as that which was held a little before! <hi>Gregory</hi> could not apprehend how his <hi>Holineſs</hi> and his <hi>Gravity</hi> (ſo the Biſhops were called) ſuffered the <hi>Apollinariſts</hi> to meet. He lets him know, that <hi>Apollinaris</hi> aſſerted. That the Body of the Son of God exiſted before the World; That the Divinity ſupplied the Place of the Soul; and, That the Body, which deſcended from Heaven, and is Eſſential to the Son, did notwithſtanding die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> fancied, I know not why, that to ſuffer thoſe Men to Meet, was to allow 'em that their Doctrine was Truer than that of the Council, ſince there cannot be Two Truths: As if to ſuffer ſome body, is to denote that one believes their Opinion to be True!</p>
            <p>Laſtly, He exhorts <hi>Nectarius</hi> to tell the Emperor, That what he had done in
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57945:139"/>the behalf of the Church, would ſignifie nothing, if Hereticks were ſuffered to Meet.</p>
            <p>Thus good <hi>Gregory,</hi> who, whilſt the <hi>Arians</hi> were ſtrongeſt, having the Emperor on their ſide, would not have that practiſed, which was blamed in them, exhorted his Succeſſor to forget that good Lecture. So difficult a thing it is not to contradict one's ſelf, when one doth not take great care to be free from Paſſion!</p>
            <p>The next Year<note n="*" place="margin">Theod. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> there was an Aſſembly of Biſhops held at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to which <hi>Gregory</hi> was invited: But he refuſed to go; and he anſwered thoſe who invited him to it, thus;<note n="†" place="margin">

As for the Tranſlation of the Works writ in Proſe, 'tis incomparably better; and it may be ſaid, that the Abbot <hi>de Billy</hi> was as fit for Proſe, as he was unfit for Verſes. 'Tis a ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thing, that a Man of his Learning took ſo much pains to tranſlate into bad Verſes, what he might have better tranſlated in Proſe. However, one may obſerve a thing, in the Tranſlation both of <hi>Gregory</hi>'s <hi>Orations</hi> and <hi>Letters;</hi> which ſhews, that one ought always to have recourſe to the Original; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Punctuation of the Tranſlation is often altogether different from that which is in the Greek, which makes it appear neater. This may ariſe partly from the fault of thoſe who put the Greek over againſt his Tranſlation, (for he publiſh'd it by it ſelf, and were not careful enough to correct it; and partly from the liberty the Tranſlator took, who cut ſeveral
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57945:140"/>Periods that were too long, and lengthened thoſe which ſeemed to him too ſhort. However, it may be ſaid in general, that 'tis one of the beſt Tranſlations of the Greek Fathers that we have, and at the ſame time one of the moſt difficult, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Style being too Florid, and even Harſh and Obſcure in ſeveral places wherein he handles ſome controverted Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
            <p>I ſhould end here the Life of <hi>Gregory,</hi> becauſe there is nothing elſe to be ſaid of him that is certain, were it not that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, a little too late, that what I have ſaid concerning the putting off of Baptiſm, may be cleared by <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf. He diſputes at large, in his Fortieth <hi>Oration,</hi> wherein he treats of Baptiſm, againſt thoſe who put it off, for the above-mention'd Reaſons. After all, it appears, to ſay ſo in a word, from that <hi>Oration,</hi> that <hi>Gregory</hi> believed,  1. That all paſt Sins are forgiven and blotted out by Baptiſm.  2. That 'tis a very difficult thing to be reſtored into a ſtate of Salvation, if one commits a mortal Sin after Baptiſm.  3. That thoſe who neglect Baptiſm, and die without it, are Damned.  4. That thoſe who die without being Baptized, but have not neglected or put off their Baptiſm by their fault, are
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57945:141"/>neither Glorified nor Puniſhed; whether they die in Childhood, or in a more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced Age, wherein they wiſhed in vain to be Baptized.</p>
            <p>It appears from that Doctrine, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, that Chriſtian Societies now-a-days, without excepting one, cannot boaſt to follow the Doctrine of the Fathers in every thing. <hi>Theology</hi> is ſubject to Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, as well as Empires; but though it hath undergone conſiderable Changes, yet the Humour of Divines is not very much alter'd; as will eaſily appear, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring what we ſee in thoſe of our time, with the Complaints <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> makes againſt thoſe who lived in his.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Whatever <hi>Socrates,</hi> and thoſe that were of his Mind, might have ſaid, a Diſcourſe artificially compoſed, and attended with the other Ornaments of Rhetorick, made ſo great an Impreſſion upon the People, that by the means of ſuch Art, they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the beſt Reaſons. This could not fail to make a great many People deſirous to learn it, and to corrupt the Minds of moſt Men: Therefore they endeavoured to know how to ſpeak agreeably and readily
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57945:143"/>upon all Subjects; and becauſe ſuch a thing depended much more upon Exerciſe, than the Knowledge of the Things themſelves, they ſpent a great deal more time in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claming, than in Forming their Judgment, and Studying the other Sciences. If they applied themſelves to Philoſophy, it was not ſo much to pleaſe themſelves with the Knowledge of the Truths which it might contain, as to appear Learned, and make uſe of them at the Barr. They chiefly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves to <hi>Dialectick;</hi> which was nothing elſe but the Art of Wrangling upon every thing, and Arguing Sophiſtically, rather than Rationally. They pretended, that they were not bound to uſe, upon the Subjects which they treated, Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Arguments, or ſuch as come as near them as can be; and they thought that it was enough to alledge Likely Arguments, not in ſuch a degree of Probability which moves the Mind by it ſelf, but in ſuch a degree as belongs to the Things which are not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to clear Truth. 'Twas almoſt enough, to ſay nothing either altogether abſurd, or whereof the Weakneſs was palpable almoſt to every body.<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,) and what is <hi>True,</hi> handled the former, in his <hi>Dialectick</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick;</hi> wherein he ſhews how to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:57945:143"/>make upon every thing Probable Diſcourſes, that is, of the Falſity whereof every body is not ſenſible.</p>
            <p>One may alſo convince one's ſelf of all this, by reading of the other Ancient Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and eſpecially the Rhetorical Books which <hi>Cicero</hi> wrote. That Art, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſays, came from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and beſides the <hi>Greeks</hi> who taught Rhetorick in it from the time of the Second <hi>Punick</hi> War, ſome Maſters did alſo teach to Declame in Latin. 'Twas one <hi>Lucius Plotius</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to exerciſe the Youth in that Language, <hi>Cicero</hi> being but a Child.</p>
            <p>They diſtinguiſhed thoſe Exerciſes into ſeveral kinds; ſometimes they took a Moral Subject, which they handled ſo as to alledge nothing that was particular, but only ſome general Notions, which had no relation to any Fact or Circumſtance. This they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Theſes,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">In Praef. Cont.</note> 
               <hi>Seneca</hi> the Rhetor ſays that thoſe were the Exerciſes practiſed before <hi>Cicero;</hi> although it appears from what hath been ſaid, that they had ſome other Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, which conſiſted in ſome Diſcourſes which they made upon a true Fact taken<note n="†" place="margin">Sucton. in lib. de Claris Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toribus.</note> out of Ancient or Modern Hiſtory: Whereupon they enquired what ought to be done on ſome Occaſions; wherein they praiſed or blamed ſome Action. <hi>Cicero</hi> calls thoſe Subjects <hi>Cauſes;</hi> and ſays in

               <note n="†" place="margin">Ep. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. l. <hi>9.</hi> Ep. <hi>16.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Dolabella</hi> Declamed at his Houſe, in an Age in which it ſeems that thoſe Exerciſes were unſeaſonable. Afterwards they found, that true Subjects taken out of ancient Hiſtory, or ſuch as lately happen'd, were not fit for that: They feigned ſome Facts, and to have more occaſion to ſay ſome extraordinary things,<note n="‖" place="margin">Petron. Init.</note> they cloathed them with ſtrange Circumſtances. There was nothing to be heard but Diſcourſes upon what a Man ſhould do, when he is ready to eſcape from a Ship-wrack, and ſeeth upon the Shore ſome Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates who will bind him with Chains; or concerning a Man whom a Tyrant ſhould command, upon pain of Death, to kill his own Father; or concerning a Father who ſhould ſee his Children carried away to be ſacrificed, by the Command of an Oracle. One may ſee a great number of ſuch like Subjects in <hi>Seneca</hi>'s and <hi>Quintilian</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. They handled them with ſuch an Eloquence, as came much nearer the Style of a Tragical Poet, than a Judicious Orator. That manner of Studying, which was admired in the following Ages, in which Men were much leſs polite, made moſt Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters meer Declamators, full of Exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſtrained Figures, Witticiſms, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57945:144"/>Punns, Arguments which prove nothing, and all the other Defects of a falſe Rhetorick. They undertook to maintain all ſorts of Subjects, without having any regard to Truth, thinking that one might more improve, by exerciſing one's ſelf to defend bad Cauſes, than to maintain good one's. Thus <hi>Julian,</hi> being yet a Chriſtian, Declamed againſt the Chriſtian Religion in the School of <hi>Libanius,</hi> only ſaid they to form his Mind, and uſe himſelf to find out probable Arguments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> on all Subjects.</p>
            <p>I was obliged ſomewhat to enlarge upon the Manner of Studying in thoſe Centuries; becauſe without having ſome Notion of it, theſe words of <hi>Prudentius,</hi> in the <hi>Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which he himſelf made of his <hi>Life,</hi> cannot be underſtood:
<q>
                  <l>Aetas prima crepantibus</l>
                  <l>Flevit ſub ferulis, mox docuit toga</l>
                  <l>Infectum vitiis falſa loqui, non fine crimine.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That laſt Verſe denotes well enough the Rhetorical Exerciſes which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, which Young Men applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to, when they had put on <hi>the thorough White Gown,</hi> that is, at Seventeen or Eighteen Years of Age. In effect, they learned thereby to ſpeak <hi>falſe things (falſa
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:57945:145"/>loqui,)</hi> which though ſpoken, as it were, out of an ingenious Fancy, yet were <hi>criminal, (non ſine crimine,)</hi> becauſe by that means they uſed themſelves by degrees to Lye, and ſpeak againſt their Conſcience. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chamillard</hi> [<hi>who put out</hi> Prudentius, <hi>in uſum Delphini</hi>] hath paraphraſed thoſe words with ſome that are more obſcure: <hi>Plenus criminibus didici dicere falſa cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minosé.</hi> But I have not mention'd the Studies of <hi>Prudentius</hi>'s time, only by reaſon of that place; but becauſe, as we ſhall ſee hereafter, there is a great many others in our Poet, which require that we ſhould think of the Manner of Studying, and the Eloquence of his Time.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtians Studied as others did, and Reaſoned almoſt as they did. One may find a pleaſant Deſcription of the Eloquence of that time, in St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Nepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. <hi>12.</hi> Ed.

               </q> For then, to ſay ſo by by the bye, Acclamations and Applauſes were uſed in Churches, as well as Theaters:<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note> Which appears by St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Advertiſement in the ſame Letter: <q rend="margQuotes">I will not have you <hi>(ſays he)</hi> to be a Declamator, and a Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler without Reaſon; but underſtand the Myſteries, and be inſtructed in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of your God. 'Tis the part of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Men, to ſeek to be Admired by the ignorant Vulgar, by rowling as it were ſome words, and reciting with an extraordinary ſwiftneſs. An impudent Man doth often explain what he knows not; and after he hath impoſed upon others, fancies himſelf to be Learned. I deſired once <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> who was formerly my Maſter, to explain to me what's meant by the <hi>Second Sabbath after the First,</hi> in St. <hi>Luke:</hi> And he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly anſwer'd, I will teach you that at Church, where, when all the People ſhall applaud me, you will be forced to know what you do not know; or if you only keep ſilence, you will be look'd upon as a Fool: <hi>Docebo te ſuper hac re in Eccleſia, in qua mihi omni populo acclamante, cogeris

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To return to <hi>Prudentius:</hi> He confeſſes, that when he applied himſelf to the Study of Eloquence, he lived after a manner ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what licentious. Afterwards he began to make uſe of his Eloquence at the Barr; where his deſire of gaining all the Cauſes he undertook to defend, either good or bad, expoſed him, as he ſays, to great Dangers. Next to that, he obtained twice the Government of ſome Provinces which he doth not name: He was in the Army for ſome time, and was raiſed by <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> or <hi>Honorius,</hi> to a conſiderable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he deſcribes in theſe terms:
<q>
                  <l>Tandem militae gradu</l>
                  <l>Evectum Pietas Principis extulit,</l>
                  <l>Aſſumptum propiùs ſtare jubens ordine proximo.</l>
               </q>
Perhaps he had been <hi>Praefect</hi> of the <hi>Praeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> which was the Chief Dignity of the Empire. 'Tis not known why, nor upon what occaſion, he retired Home; but it appears, that in the Fifty ſeventh Year of his Age, he wrote the Preface of his <hi>Hymns for Every Day;</hi> wherein he alludes to his
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:57945:146"/>ſeveral Works (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 35, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which he deſigned, or had already compoſed, but perhaps were not yet made publick. They all run upon ſome Subjects of Devotion, and part of them are in <hi>Lyrick,</hi> and part in <hi>Heroick</hi> Verſes; yet he was not born for Poetry, and it doth not appear that he had much Learning. He doth very often miſtake the Quantity not only of Greek Words, the Orthography of which he doth not ſeem to have well underſtood, but alſo of Latin Words, of which one may find ſome Liſts in his Interpreters. He alſo uſes many words of the Latinity of his time, and a Style which could only be liked then. The noble Facility of the ancient Poets, nor ſo much of <hi>Claudian,</hi> who lived at the ſame time, doth not appear in it; and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his Style is low, and proſaick e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, though he doth whatever he can to raiſe it. His Heat fails him at every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: One may perceive that Age had leſſen'd the Heat of his Fancy, and that he could not ſupply it by the Light of his Mind. But if his Poetry doth not pleaſe by its Elegancy, yet it may be uſeful, becauſe one may learn from it ſeveral Opinions and Cuſtoms of his time, beſides ſome Facts concerning the Hiſtory of Martyrs; as it will appear by the following Examination of ſome Places of our Poet.</p>
            <pb n="292" facs="tcp:57945:147"/>
            <p>I. The Book entitled <hi>Hymns for Every Day,</hi> contains Twelve of them, compoſed as if they were to be ſung or recited on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Occaſions, at Break of Day, at one's Riſing, before and after Meals, when they light the Candle, when one goes to Bed, on a Faſt and after Faſting, at all times, at a Funeral, on <hi>Chriſtmas-Day,</hi> and on the <hi>Epiphany.</hi> The Preface which is before thoſe Hymns ſeems to be rather a General Preface for all the Poems of <hi>Prudentius;</hi> ſince (as I have already obſerved) he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes therein to all his Works; and ſays, that he is reſolved to leave for ever his worldly Employments, that he might alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether apply himſelf to write Verſes to the Praiſe of God, againſt Hereſies, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Religion, to explain that of Chriſt, and upon the Martyrs and Apoſtles. Thoſe are the Subjects upon which all the Poems of <hi>Prudentius</hi> run.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One may obſerve, that that Poet men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſeveral popular Opinions of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in his time, which they took from the Heathens, as that which is to be found in the Firſt Hymn (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 38.) wherein he aſſures us that they ſaid, <hi>That the Daemons, whom the Darkneſſes of the Night rejoyces, withdraw when the Day appears.</hi> The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans believed that the Demi-Gods retired into ſome Deſart Places, and wandred in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57945:147"/>the Night, and at Full-Noon, (as I have obſerved elſewhere; to which the 72, 73, and 74 Verſes of <hi>Callimacus</hi> his Hymn, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled <hi>The Baths of Pallas,</hi> may be joined, wherein he ſays that that Goddeſs bathed herſelf at the ſame time that Mount <hi>Citheron</hi> enjoyed <hi>the Rest of Noon.</hi> What the Latins ſaid concerning their <hi>Lemures</hi> and <hi>Striges,</hi> is well known.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is many Expreſſions in <hi>Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> which are very harſh, and ſeem to ſay much more than he deſigned. For Example,<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. <hi>v.</hi> 58.</note> ſpeaking of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he ſays:
<q>
                  <l>Flevit negator denique</l>
                  <l>Ex ore prolapſum nefas,</l>
                  <l>Cum Mens maneret Innocens,</l>
                  <l>Animuſque ſervaret fidem.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems that he meant no more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> That though St. <hi>Peter</hi> had ſworn that he knew not our Lord, yet he kept in his mind the ſame Sentiments for him which he had before. But his words taken in a rigorous ſence, ſeem to ſay that a Man may ſpeak againſt his Conſcience, and yet have his Mind free from Guilt, as in <hi>Euripides</hi>'s Verſe:
<q>Juravi Lingua, Mentam Injuratam gero.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="294" facs="tcp:57945:148"/>
            <p>Thoſe who delight too much in a Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Style, are liable to the like Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Thus St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his Book<note n="*" place="margin">Oxon. Ed. <hi>127.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>de Lapſis,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe who were overcome by the violence of Torments, ſays, <hi>Infirmitas viſcerum ſenſit, nec animus ſed corpus dolore defecit:</hi> "'Tis not the "Mind, but the Body that failed.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſee in the Sequel of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe another remarkable Example, by which it will appear that <hi>Prudentius</hi> ſays more than he means.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the Evelenth Hymn, to be recited in the Morning,<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 29.</note> there is a ſlight Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Horace;</hi> wherein having ſaid, that in the Morning every body betakes himſelf to his Affairs, <hi>Prudentius</hi> adds:
<q>
                  <l>Miles, Togatus, navita,</l>
                  <l>Opifex, arator, inſtitor:</l>
                  <l>Illum forenſis gloria</l>
                  <l>Hunc triſte raptat claſſicum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>One may ſee the beginning of the Firſt Satyr of <hi>Horace,</hi> by which it will appear, that by <hi>Togatus,</hi> we are to underſtand a <hi>Juris Conſult,</hi> or a Lawyer. F. <hi>Chamillard</hi> underſtands a Judge by it: But what I have ſaid, and <hi>forenſis gloria,</hi> which follows, ſhew that the Poet means, a Perſon who frequented the Barr, to get Glory by Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57945:148"/>not to do Juſtice in it. This agrees well enough with the Diviſion of the Day, which we find in <hi>Martial, l.</hi> 4. <hi>Ep.</hi> 8.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Prima ſalutantes atque altera diſtinet Hora,</l>
               <l>Exercet raucos tertia Cauſidicos.</l>
            </q>
            <p>In the words of <hi>Cicero,</hi> cited by F. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millard, Cedant arma togae, Toga</hi> doth not ſignifie the Judgments given in time of Peace, and hath no relation with Junica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but denotes <hi>Eloquence,</hi> as it appears by the reſt of the Verſe, <hi>Concedat Laurea Linguae.</hi> This is not the only place wherein Criticks will not agree with our Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For Example; <hi>Prudentius,</hi> in the Third Hymn<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>to be recited Before Meals,</hi> calls Chriſt <hi>Verbigena;</hi> where F. <hi>Chamillard</hi> doth well obſerve, that according to the Analogy of the Latin Tongue, that word ſignifies <hi>Begotten,</hi> or <hi>Born of the Word,</hi> as <hi>Martigena</hi> ſignifies <hi>Born of Mars.</hi> Yet he maintains that this is not <hi>Prudentius</hi>'s mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe it is contrary to the Faith, which teaches us, that Chriſt is the very Word of his Father, not a Production of the Father's Word; ſo that he explains <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigena, Begotten Word.</hi> But as we would not have our Words to be always explained according to the Notions and Terms of the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57945:149"/>Antients; 'tis not juſt that we ſhould make 'em ſpeak as we do, unleſs it be evident that they have really uſed the ſame Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the ſame ſence. That Rule ought always to be obſerved, but eſpecially when the Queſtion is about an Incomprehenſible Subject, as on this occaſion; for indeed, whatever Expreſſions be uſed, it doth not become more Intelligible. Beſides, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from another place of <hi>Prudentius,</hi> that by <hi>Verbigena,</hi> he underſtood, <hi>Begotten by Speaking.</hi> Here are his words in<note n="*" place="margin">

               </q> — F. <hi>Chamillard</hi> paraphraſes this latter word by that of <hi>Limbus;</hi> as if <hi>Prudentius,</hi> by the Name of one of the Rivers of Hell, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what they call <hi>Limbus Patrum.</hi> 'Tis certain, that the Pagans, who firſt uſed the word <hi>Phlegethon,</hi> denoted by it, not a River of the <hi>Elyſian Fields,</hi> or <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Iſlands,</hi> but of Hell, and the Place of Torments. So that unleſs <hi>Prudentius</hi> ex-explains it elſewhere, or the general Opinion of the Chriſtians of that time leads that way, the Criticks will have much ado to apprehend why the word <hi>Phlegethon</hi> ſhould not denote in <hi>Prudentius</hi> the Place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now, having examined all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in <hi>Prudentius,</hi> wherein that Name, and thoſe of the other Rivers of Hell are uſed, I find that <hi>Prudentius</hi> denotes by thoſe terms, not a Place of Reſt, but a Place wherein the Souls are Tormented. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes that Place as the Heathen Poets do,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57945:151"/>either with reſpect to its Situation, or the Torments which they ſuffer there. Thus in the <hi>Apotheoſis,</hi> Verſ. 743, he ſpeaks to <hi>Lazarus</hi> in theſe terms, <hi>Dic cujus vocem tellure ſub ima,</hi> &amp;c. <q rend="margQuotes">Tell us whoſe Voice you heard under the loweſt Places of the Earth, and what Force went through the hidden Places where the Dead make their abode: Since when Chriſt recall'd you, and order'd you to come forth from the Black Depth wherein you was, you heard it as if you had been near. By what ſo neighbouring an Abyſs is the Kingdom of of Darkneſs almoſt joined with the Upper Parts of the Earth? Where is the diſmal <hi>Tenarus,</hi> by which they go down through a vaſt Extent? and that Hidden River, which rouls Flames in its Channel, which nothing can fill?</q>
            </p>
            <p>It appears from thence, that <hi>Prudentius</hi> placed Hell under the Earth, at a very great diſtance from the Place wherein the Living dwell: as <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Heſiod,</hi> who ſay that <hi>Tartarus</hi> is as far from hence, as Heaven is; and that an Iron Anvil thrown from Heaven upon Earth, or from hence to <hi>Tartarus,</hi> could get thither but in Ten Days.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Hamartigeny,</hi> Ver. 824. he deſcribes Hell in the following words:
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57945:151"/>
               <q>
                  <l>Praeſcius inde Pater liventia Tartara plumbo</l>

               </q>
One would almoſt think that 'tis a Heathen Poet who ſpeaks thus; but he is not the only one who hath done the ſame; the Jews before and after Chriſt, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians, expreſt themſelves in the ſame terms.</p>
            <p>Now, if it be asked what was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Fathers concerning the Place into which Chriſt deſcended, and thoſe he took out of it; I anſwer, That there was ſome diverſity of Opinions amongſt 'em upon that Subject, although they agree in ſome reſpects. They<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> upon the Fifth Article of the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> pag. 256, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> all conſtantly ſay that Chriſt deſcended into the ſubterranean Places where the Dead make their abode; but they don't agree about the Perſons to whom he made himſelf known, and the End for which he went to them, becauſe they had not the ſame Notions concerning the State of the Dead. Some who by the words <hi>Hades</hi> and <hi>Infernus,</hi> underſtood the Places wherein the Souls of all Men, both Good and Bad, are expecting the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, believed that the Soul of Chriſt deſcended towards the Souls of thoſe who
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:57945:152"/>died in the fear of God, as the Patriarchs and Prophers. But ſome others, as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> who thought that thoſe words are never to be found in the Scripture for a Place of Happineſs, and conſequently could not apprehend that the Souls of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs and Prophets ſhould be detained in it; thoſe Fathers, I ſay, could not believe that Chriſt, in his Deſcent into Hell, went to the Prophets and Patriarchs who were not there.</p>
            <p>Some of thoſe who followed the former Opinion, as <hi>Euſebius,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> believed that Chriſt took from Hell the Souls of Good Men, and led them into Heaven. That's the Opinion of the modern School-men, and which F. <hi>Chamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard</hi> ſeems to follow in his Paraphraſe. But others who had the ſame Thoughts, with reſpect to the word <hi>Hades,</hi> believed that the Souls were ſtill in a ſubterranean Place, which they call <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Boſom,</hi> where they were to ſtay till the Day of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> St. <hi>Irenaeus, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> were of that Opinion.</p>
            <p>Others, who maintained that the Souls of the Patriarchs could not be in a Place call'd <hi>Hell,</hi> which, in their Opinion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes only the Place of Torments in the Scripture, ſaid that Chriſt really deſcended
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57945:152"/>into the Place wherein the Devils and wicked Men are tormented. They believed he went thither to deliver the Souls which were there to ſuffer the Puniſhment which their Sins deſerved. Some pretended that Chriſt had only delivered a certain number of thoſe Souls; and others, that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together emptied Hell. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>

            <p n="1">1. It doth clearly appear from ſeveral Places in thoſe Hymns, that they Prayed to Martyrs at that time, and believed that they were appointed Patrons of ſome Places by God. Some Proteſtant Writers, who fancy that the Tradition of the Four or Five firſt Centuries of the Church ought to be joined with the Scripture, have denied that the Saints were Prayed to in the Fourth Century; but they ſhould not have framed a Notional Syſtem, before they were well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in Facts, ſince they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of this by ſeveral places out of <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius.</hi> Thus in the<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>If thoſe Circumſtances, and many more, are true, it doth neceſſarily follow, that they ſpared then, in ſome meaſure, the Blood of the Chriſtians, and put but few of them to death, to terrifie others, ſince they did not put to death ſuch Perſons as made a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Declaration. Yet if we believe thoſe who wrote ſince the Hiſtory of thoſe Times, 'twas enough to ſhew that one was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to ſuffer Martyrdom; and the Rivers were red with the innocent Blood that was ſhed, to confeſs the Name of Chriſt.

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:57945:160"/>witneſs St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s Action, who tore a Vail in a Church of a Village in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> named <hi>Anablatha,</hi> becauſe there was a Picture upon it, ſaying, that it was againſt <hi>the Authority of the Scripture.</hi> He himſelf relates that Action, in a Letter to <hi>John</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into Latin, and ſpeaks of it as of an Action which no body could blame, and which was grounded upon the Doctrine of the Apoſtles. However, it apears from <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius,</hi> that this was not the Opinion of the whole Chriſtian Church; and one may ſee thereby, that the ſingle Teſtimony of one Father is not ſufficient to judge of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of all the Chriſtians, as 'tis but too often practiſed.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Prudentius</hi> his <hi>Apotheoſis</hi> is a Poem in Heroick Verſes, wherein he aſſaults ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Errors either of ſome Hereticks, or of the Jews. He attacks,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Patripaſſians,</hi> or Diſciples of <hi>Noêtus,</hi> who lived about the Year 240, who diſtinguiſhed no <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> in the Deity, and believing that it was united to Chriſt, maintained that the Father had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered as well as the Son.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57945:160"/>they did not aſcribe to him the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which they drew from it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Prudentius</hi> endeavours to prove againſt him, that the Father never made himſelf Viſible, and that conſequently it cannot be ſaid that he dwelt in Chriſt; but it muſt be confeſt that this is a very weak Argument, according to the Notions of our Modern Divines. For if the Eſſence of the Son be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in ſome reſpect Viſible by being United to Chriſt, that of the Father became Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible at the ſame time, becauſe 'tis but One only Eſſence in <hi>Number.</hi>

The following Poem, entitled <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martigeny,</hi> or, <hi>The Birth of Sin,</hi> is againſt the Opinions of the <hi>Manicheans</hi> and <hi>Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> who believed Two Collateral Gods, whereof the one was the Author of Good, and the other of Evil. <hi>Prudentius</hi> doth ſcarce any thing but ſet down the common Opinion, and repeat ſeveral ways, That there is but One All-Good God; and that he whom the Hereticks make Equal with Him, is an Angel fallen from his Innocency, who induced Men to Sin, and is really the cauſe of moſt Evils which happen in the World, which our Poet deſcribes at large.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Manicheans</hi> and <hi>Marcionites</hi> raiſed an Objection againſt the Orthodox, which <hi>Prudentius</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 640.</note> alledges, without abating any thing of its ſtrength; <hi>viz.</hi> That if the God who governs the World did not delight in Sin, he would hinder it; ſince he is not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Mens Corruption, and can hinder it. They pretended, that to do Ill, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it, was the ſame thing, when it can be remedied. <hi>Prudentius</hi> anſwer, Firſt, That it doth plainly appear, that God delights not in Sin; ſince he applies a Remedy to it, and ſaves thoſe who abſtain from it. But, replied the Hereticks, Men cannot Sin, if God will not; ſince he maſters Mens Hearts, and turns them as he pleaſes. Our
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57945:163"/>Poet doth not reſolve this Difficulty any other way, than by having recourſe to Free-Will, without which, there can be neither Vice nor Vertue. He doth much enlarge upon that, and proves it, not only by the Example of our Firſt Parents, but of <hi>Lot</hi> and his Wife, <hi>Noemi</hi>'s Daughter-in-Law; and of two Brothers, one of whom is ſeen every day to embrace Vertue, and the other to give up himſelf to Vice: To which he adds<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 508.</note> this general Maxim:
<q>
                  <l>Omnibus una ſubest Natura: ſed exitus omnes</l>
                  <l>Non unus peragit, placitorum ſegrege formâ.</l>
               </q>
               <q rend="margQuotes">All Men are not of the ſame Nature, but all have not the ſame End, becauſe they do not all purſue the ſame thing.</q> —</p>
            <p>It appears from what hath been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the <hi>Prudentius</hi> believed that Men are born corrupted; but one may ſee by what he ſays here, that he believed not that that Corruption did irreſiſtibly determine 'em to do Ill. To which he adds. That becauſe Men may be Good or Bad, as they will, God hath appointed Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If the <hi>Manicheans</hi> had further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to him, That it ſeems 'twere better if there was no Freedom of Will, nor Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, beſtowed as a Reward, and if Men
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57945:163"/>neceſſarily applying themſelves to Good, were neceſſarily happy, than to make Men ſo diſmal a Preſent as Free-Will, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes moſt of them to an Eternal Miſery: If, I ſay, the <hi>Manicheans</hi> had raiſed ſuch an Objection againſt him, he would perhaps have made uſe of his Principle, which I have already mention'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That few Men fall into that Miſery. And who knows but <hi>Prudentius</hi> came by that Notion becauſe of that Objection, which might eaſily come into his Mind?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Prudentius,</hi> deſcribing the Flying of <hi>Lot,</hi> uſes a word which cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood without the help of the <hi>Old French,</hi> which hath its Original immediately from the bad Latin: 'Tis in the 773 Verſe:
<q>Alter (Lot) ſe proripit, altera muſſat.</q>
That is, <hi>Et l'autre muſe;</hi> in better Latin, <hi>Nectit moros.</hi> Father <hi>Chamillard</hi> paraphraſes it <hi>Murmure,</hi> in effect <hi>Muſſare</hi> ſignified that in the ancient Latinity, but afterwards it changed its ſignification. But that's an Obſervation of no great moment: I had rather obſerve another thing which <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius</hi> ſays in the ſame Hiſtory, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife was not only changed into a Statue of Salt, but alſo, that that Statue was
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57945:164"/>perfectly like her, and had the Head turned backwards; That it was ſtill extant; and though the Salt did melt, and was often licked by the Cattle, yet it did not leſſen. It ſeems that our Poet had this out of a Poem upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> aſcribed to <hi>Tertullian,</hi> wherein 'tis ſaid moreover, that 'twas known every Month, by a certain Mark, that 'twas a Woman's Statue. I think I am able<note n="*" place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath done it ſince, in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
               </note> to ſhew, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays not that <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife was metamorphoſed into a Statue of Salt; but this is not a fit place to enlarge upon that Matter, or ſhew, that what is related concerning the Statue of Salt, are meer Fables.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At the end of this Poem <hi>Prudentius</hi> offers a Prayer to God, which deſerves to be obſerved. He prays, <q rend="margQuotes">That when he is dead, he may not ſee a Devil, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his Soul into the Black Dens, where he will be forced to pay whatever he owes, to the laſt Farthing. He doth not beg to be in the Place where the Bleſſed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Virgins dwell. He ſays he'll be content, provided he ſees no Devil, and Hell devours not his Soul; that ſince is is neceſſary, becauſe of the Corruption which his Soul had contracted in his Body, he conſents to be ſwallowed up by the ſod Fire of <hi>Avernus,</hi> provided however
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57945:164"/>that it ſhall not be too hot. Let others <hi>(ſays he)</hi> be gloriouſly crowned in an Immenſe Light, and I but lightly burnt.</q>

               <hi>Prudentius</hi> adds not, that he hoped to get out of that Place in the Day of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; ſo that one cannot affirm, that he underſtands by it what was ſince called <hi>Purgatory,</hi> as F. <hi>Chamillard</hi> thinks. The Antients differed ſo much among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerning thoſe Matters, that we cannot tell whether <hi>Prudentius</hi> had not a private Opinion of his own concerning this; and believed not, that a leſſer degree of Heat, though it ſhould laſt for ever, was a hind of Happineſs. In effect, he ranks the Place wherein he wiſhed to be, among the ſeveral Habitations in the Houſe of God, which Chriſt ſpeaks of, <hi>John</hi> xix.</p>

            <p n="5">V. The <hi>Pſychomachy</hi> is an Allegorical Poem, wherein <hi>Prudentius</hi> deſcribes a Fight of Vertues againſt Vices, and wherein there is nothing that's remarkable.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The two Books againſt <hi>Symmachus</hi> were compoſed a little while after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of <hi>Alarick</hi> by <hi>Stilichon,</hi> in the Year 402. as it appears from the 695 Verſe of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book, wherein <hi>Prudentius</hi> mentions that Defeat, as having lately happened. <hi>Symmachus,</hi> a Pagan and Praefect of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> the moſt Eloquent Orator of his time, had about eighteen Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſented a Requeſt to <hi>Valentinianus, Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius,</hi> to obtain from them the re-eſtabliſhment of an Altar and Statue of <hi>Victory,</hi> which was in the Place where the Senate met, and which <hi>Gratianus</hi> took away.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57945:165"/>Proſe, as to what concerns the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; though the Reaſons of the latter, being only the Reaſons of a Declamator, are very much beneath thoſe of <hi>Prudentius.</hi> Yet <hi>Prudentius</hi> ſays ſcarce any thing againſt the Pagan Religion, but what other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Authors, who wrote upon the ſame Matter, ſaid before him. He ſpends his Firſt Book in that, and anſwers <hi>Symmachus</hi>'s Reaſons only in the Second.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One may learn from two Places of the Firſt Book, that there was then but a ſmall number of Heathens in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius</hi> teaches us, that the greateſt number of the Senators were Chriſtians too; <q rend="margQuotes">Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had thrown down the Images of the Gods, by a Decree of the Senate
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57945:166"/>made by the Majority of Votes. <hi>He ſays,</hi> That the Senators gave freely their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Propoſal of the Emperor for it; which was evident, becauſe that Prince did equally honour Merit in the Pagans and Chriſtians.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Simmachus</hi> had drawn an Argument for the Pagan Religion from its Antiquity, which he expreſſed very elegantly; <hi>Si longa aet as authoritatem religionibus faciat, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanda est tot ſaeculis ſides, &amp; ſequendi ſunt nobis Parentes, qui feliciter ſequuti ſunt ſuos:</hi>
               <q rend="margQuotes">If length of Time is of ſome weight in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, we ought not to depart from the Belief of ſo many Centuries; we ought to imitate our Fathers, who did ſo well imitate theirs.</q>— This is ſo well worded, that the ableſt Miſſionary cannot preach better againſt the Innovators. Yet <hi>Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> anſwers chiefly two things againſt that Argument, which are ſo judicious, that the moſt learned Innovator cannot anſwer a Miſſionary better. The Firſt is, That if the manner of Living of paſt Ages, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be preferr'd before that of the time wherein one lives, the <hi>Romans</hi> of that time ſhould have renounced all the Conveniences of Life, trodden under foot all Sciences, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd the Inconveniences and Barbarity of the Age of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and ſacrificed Humane
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57945:166"/>Victims to him. The Second thing is, That the Religion of the <hi>Romans</hi> was very much altered ſince <hi>Saturnus,</hi> and even <hi>Romulus</hi>'s time:

            <head>THE HISTORY OF PELAGIANISM.</head>
            <p>IN the Fourth Century, a vaſt number of People went to viſit the <hi>Holy Places</hi> in <hi>Puleſtine;</hi> which made the Books of <hi>Origen</hi> to be known in the <hi>West,</hi> where they were unknown before. <hi>Rufinus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, a Prieſt of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> having lived thirty Years in the <hi>East,</hi> and ſtudied under <hi>Evagrius</hi> an <hi>Origenist,</hi> not only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Opinions of <hi>Origen,</hi> but being returned into <hi>Italy,</hi> ſpread them every where, by tranſlating ſeveral of his Works. <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Celeſtius</hi> learned of him at <hi>Rome</hi> that Doctrine, of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. They were both Monks, and of <hi>Great Britain; Celeſtius</hi> was a <hi>Scotch-man,</hi> and <hi>Pelagius</hi> an <hi>Engliſh-man:</hi> The latter's Name was <hi>Morgan,</hi> in the Language of his

St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> undertook to confute one of thoſe Writings of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> in his Book <hi>De Natura &amp; Gratia.</hi> He accuſes him, on the one hand, of confounding the <hi>Graces</hi> which God gives to Men, when he creates them, with thoſe by which he regenerates; and on the other hand, of ſaying, that God beſtows his Graces according to Mens Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and that thoſe Graces are only Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; but we ſhall ſee hereafter how <hi>Pelagius</hi> explained his meaning.</p>

For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he happen'd to be in <hi>Africa</hi> when <hi>Celeſtius</hi> was Condemned there, he told the Aſſembly of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with what Zeal that of <hi>Carthage</hi> had Condemned that Heretick, and that St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had wrote a Book againſt <hi>Pelagius;</hi> and beſides, confuted the <hi>Queries</hi> of <hi>Celeſtius,</hi> in a Letter ſent to <hi>Sicily.</hi> Having that Letter about him, he offer'd to rend it, and read it at the Requeſt of the Aſſembly. <q rend="margQuotes">After the reading of it, Biſhop <hi>John</hi> deſired that <hi>Pelagius</hi> ſhould be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.

               <q rend="margQuotes">The Biſhop ſaid afterwards, that if <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius</hi> maintained, that Man may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin, without God's Help, it would be a condemnable Doctrine; but that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied not God's Aſſiſtance, and asked what we had to ſay to that? whether we denied the Neceſſity of that Aſſiſtance?

               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That none can be without Sin, without knowing the Law.</hi> He anſwered, That he meant only by it, that the Law was a help to avoid Sin; not that ſuch a Knowledge was ſufficient not to Sin.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That all Men are led by their Will.</hi> He owned that Propoſition, by ſaying, That though Man hath a Free-Will; yet when he chuſes well, 'tis by God's Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</item>

                  <item>6. <hi>That Man may be without Sin, if he will, Pelagius</hi> ſaid, That he had maintained, that this was poſſible by the Grace of God; but, that he never taught, that any Man had lived without Sin from his Childhood to his Old Age. He alſo denied, that he had maintained ſome other Doctrines, of which he was accuſed. Whereupon he was ask'd, whether he did not Anathematize thoſe who were of that Opinion? <hi>I Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57945:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>'em</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>as Fools, not as Hereticks; for what they ſay is not a Doctrine.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. He was accuſed of maintaining the Opinions which had been condemned at <hi>Carthage,</hi> which have been before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; and beſides, <hi>That a Child may be ſaved without Baptiſm.</hi> He replied, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that he ever taught any thing after the manner it was reported, eſpecially that ever he ſaid, that thoſe who lived before Chriſt, have been without Sin.</item>
                  <item>8. Some places which were ſaid to be extracted out of <hi>Celeſtius</hi> his Books, were propoſed to him; but he ſaid he could not warrant what another had writ, and that he anathematized thoſe who maintained Propoſitions ſo worded. Amongſt other Propoſitions, this was one of 'em, <hi>That Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who repent, obtain the Forgiveneſs of their Sins, not by the Grace and Mercy of God, but according to their Merits and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence.</hi> Perhaps, this was only a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence drawn from <hi>Celeſtius</hi>'s Opinions; for in this whole Controverſie, both Parties aſcribed to one another well or ill drawn Conſequences, as expreſs and formal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.

            <p>The Council having approved all his Anſwers, declared him worthy of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Catholick Church. But the Enemies of <hi>Pelagius</hi> accuſed him of having concealed his true Opinions and deceived thoſe Greek Biſhops, to whom he ſpoke only by an Interpreter.

               <hi>Pelagius,</hi> as may be ſeen by an infinite number of Places out of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and St. <hi>Iſidorus</hi> of <hi>Damietta,</hi> his Diſciple, whom ſome late Authors have openly accuſed of <hi>Pelagianiſm.</hi> Therefore 'tis not to be wonder'd, that Greek Biſhops ſhould approve the Language of that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monk.</p>
            <p>Before the Acts of that Council were publiſhed, <hi>Pelagius</hi> wrote to a Friend of his, that his Opinions had been approved in it,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57945:174"/>and made his Letter publick. He alſo made a kind of an Apology for that Council, in the Year 416, which he ſent to the Biſhop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> who having received no other from <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> durſt not truſt it. He, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome other <hi>African</hi> Biſhops, wrote to <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to have the very Acts of the Council of <hi>Dioſpolis.</hi> In the mean time, St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who had written againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and eſpecially againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> occaſion'd a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order which happen'd at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where a Deacon was kill'd, and ſome Monaſteries were burnt. The Biſhop was accuſed of having ſtirred that Tumult; but they had not time enough to bring him to an account for it, becauſe he died the ſame Year. St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> having alſo offended the Biſhops of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> by deſpiſing their Aſſemblies, thought the beſt way to maintain himſelf, was to rely upon the Friendſhip of thoſe of <hi>Africa,</hi> though he was not of their Opinion in every thing, being of that of the <hi>Semi-Pelagians,</hi> of whom I ſhall ſpeak in the Sequel of this Hiſtory. Wherefore he wrote to St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> in theſe terms; <q rend="margQuotes">I am reſolved to love, honour, reſpect and admire you, and to defend what you ſay, as if I had ſaid it: <hi>Mihi decretum est te amare, te ſuſpicere, te colere, te mirari, tuaque dicta quaſi mea defendere.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Pelagius</hi> was accuſed every where of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying altogether the Aſſiſtance of Grace. To juſtifie himſelf, he wrote a Book concerning Free-Will, where he ſhewed, that he<note n="*" place="margin">Petav. de Pelag. c. <hi>2,</hi> &amp;c.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged ſix ſorts of Grace.</p>
            <p n="1">Firſt, 'Tis a <hi>Grace of God,</hi> according to <hi>Pelagius, to have a Rational and Free Soul;</hi> that is to ſay, which may obey or not obey God, without being unavoidably determin'd either to the one or the other. <hi>Pelagius</hi> maintained, that all Men were born in that ſtate; ſo that if they applied themſelves to Evil, it was not by an Unavoidable Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but by an ill uſe of their Liberty. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> maintained, Firſt, That what we receive from God by Creation, ought not to be called a <hi>Grace,</hi> on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but only what we receive from him, by virtue of our Redemption. But that's only a Diſpute about Words. Beſides, St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> denied that Men are born otherwiſe than unavoidably determined to do Ill; and ſaid, that 'twas impoſſible for them to do any Good, without an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Aſſiſtance of God, which he only beſtowed upon ſome; and that thoſe who had not that Aſſiſtance, were unavoidably enclined to Evil. Thus, though he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Name of <hi>Free-Will,</hi> he put a new ſence upon thoſe words; ſince <hi>Freedom,</hi> in his Opinion, is only a meer <hi>Spotaneity,</hi> and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57945:175"/>doth not imply a Power of not doing what one doth. The difference therefore that was between St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and <hi>Pelagius</hi> in this Matter, is, that the former believed, that ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> Men are ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that they are born with ill Habits, which do neceſſarily encline them to do Evil; That if God would encline them to Good, he muſt beſtow upon them, for every Good Action, a Grace, which makes 'em unavoidably willing to do Good: And further, That thoſe to whom he gave not that Grace, were Damn'd; God, by a Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which we do not comprehend, being willing that Mankind ſhould be born with an unavoidable Neceſſity of Offending him, and of being afterwards tormented with Everlaſting Puniſhments, without freeing from that diſmal Neceſſity but a very ſmall number of Perſons, upon whom he beſtows an Irreſiſtible Grace. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that this was to give God the Glory due to him. <hi>Pelagius,</hi> on the contrary, believed that God had not permitted that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin ſhould cauſe ſo great a Diſorder in the World; that thoſe who deſcended from him, ſhould not be able ſtill to obey or not obey God's Law, who gave their Souls the power of avoiding Evil, and doing Good; ſo that they were Damned only by their Fault, without being bound to Sin
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57945:176"/>and Everlaſting Miſery by any unavoidable Neceſſity. Having received a Free-Will from God, 'twas not neceſſary that God ſhould interpoſe in every Action.<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>To be able to do Good</hi> (ſaid <hi>Pelagius</hi>) <hi>comes from God, who gave it to his Creature; but to be willing to do Good, and to practice Vertue, depends on Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">The Second <hi>Grace,</hi> which <hi>Pelagius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, is the <hi>Forgiveneſs of Past Sins,</hi> which God grants to thoſe who mend their Lives. <hi>Pelagius</hi> Anathematized, in the Council of <hi>Dioſpolis,</hi> whoſoever durſt ſay that God hath any reſpect to <hi>Merits</hi> on this occaſion. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complains, that <hi>Pelagius,</hi> being content to acknowledge that God freely forgives us our Paſt Sins, confeſt not that he helps us to abſtain from them hereafter. But <hi>Pelagius</hi> maintain'd that that Forgiveneſs helped us to do our Duty for the time to come, ſeeing we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not betake our ſelves to ſerve God when we have offended him, but by being perſuaded that he will freely forgive us what is paſt. He further ſaid, that as to thoſe Sins which were committed in the very time of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that is, in the ſtate of Regeneration, they were forgiven us, in conſideration of our Good Works, by which we alſo come to Glory. And in that ſence he maintained that Grace is given according to Merits,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57945:176"/>that is, according to Good Works. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as Children, before the uſe of Reaſon, commit no Sin, they are not concerned in that kind of Grace.</p>
            <p n="3">The <hi>Third Grace</hi> (according to <hi>Pelagius</hi>) is the <hi>Law,</hi> that is to ſay, the Preaching of the Goſpel, and the Example of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which thoſe who lived under the Old Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation had not. He ſaid, that this Grace was altogether neceſſary, to live like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p n="4">The <hi>Fourth</hi> ſort of <hi>Grace,</hi> is <hi>an Inward Illumination of our Minds,</hi> which <hi>Pelagius</hi> expreſt thus:<note n="*" place="margin">Apud Aug lib. de Grat. Chr. c. <hi>7.</hi>

               <q rend="margQuotes">I maintain, that Grace doth not only conſiſt in the Law, but in the Aſſiſtance of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, God aſſiſts us by his Doctrine and Revelation, by opening the Eyes of our Hearts; by ſhewing us things to come, to hinder us from being too much taken up with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things; by diſcovering to us the Snares of the Devil; by enligthning us with the various and unſpeakable Gifts of his Heavenly Grace. Do you think (adds <hi>Pelagius</hi>) that thoſe who ſpeak thus, deny the Grace of God? Do they not rather acknowledge both Free-Will and the Grace of God together?</q> — St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes <hi>Pelagius,</hi> on this occaſion, not of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving poſitively denied Grace, but of having denied the Neceſſity of it; and ſaid, that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:57945:177"/>God did only give it, that Free-Will might the more eaſily encline to Good. That Grace, according to <hi>Pelagius,</hi> doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly and by it ſelf produce the Will of Doing Good, and Good Works, but only enclines to be more eaſily Willing.</p>
            <p n="5">The <hi>Fifth</hi> is, the <hi>Grace of Baptiſm,</hi> by which, according to him, although Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren receive not the Forgiveneſs of Sins, which they have not committed, being, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Pelagius,</hi> altogether Innocent, yet they enter into a better ſtate, which conſiſts in their being thereby adopted by God, and becoming Heirs of the Heavenly Kingdom. On the contrary, St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> maintained, that Children being born Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Baptiſm confers upon them the Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin, and ſanctifies them by a Grace which God hath annexed to it.</p>

According to <hi>Pelagius,</hi> that Grace was given conſequently to <hi>Merits,</hi> that is to ſay, a Good Life. 'Tis a hard matter to know wherein that Diſtinction of <hi>Eternal Life</hi> and <hi>Kingdom of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:57945:177"/>Heaven</hi> did conſiſt, and to reconcile it with the Accuſation raiſed againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> that the Kingdom of Heaven was promiſed under the Old Teſtament. St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaid upon this laſt Article, that if by the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>Legal Covenant</hi> was underſtood, it did not promiſe Eternal Life; but if all the Books of the Old Teſtament were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by it, 'twas true, that it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed therein, although the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is not mention'd in them, that Phraſe belonging to the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>There was never a Diſpute more intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate than this, becauſe each Party being urged with ſome troubleſom Conſequences, endeavoured to get rid of them with the help of ſome Terms, upon which they put a Sence different from that which they had in the Mouth of their Adverſaries. The word <hi>Grace,</hi> when uſed by <hi>Pelagius,</hi> did not ſignifie the ſame thing as when uſed by the Biſhop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> and the latter gave the Name of <hi>Liberty</hi> to a thing which was not ordinarily ſo called. In ſhort, ſeveral People believe, that if the chief Words that have been uſed in that Controverſie, and the Idea's that have been fixed to 'em, were examined, it would be found, that there is ſcarce any of thoſe Idea's that is very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:57945:178"/>ſo as to know perfectly the meaning of a Word to which one of thoſe Idea's is fixed, when 'tis pronounced. Nay, there is, in their opinion, ſome of thoſe words to which no Idea at all hath been fixed: ſo that in ſome parts of that Diſpute, both Parties do in a manner imitate a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and an <hi>Arabian,</hi> who knowing only their Mother-Tongue, ſhould ſpeak by turns as loud as they could, and ſometimes both at one time, without underſtanding one another, and ſhould afterwards boaſt each of them of having overcome his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
            <p>Thus we have ſeen wherein the Opinions of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his Adverſaries, concerning <hi>Grace,</hi> did chiefly conſiſt. As to <hi>Election,</hi> it ſeems that <hi>Pelagius</hi> believed Two ſorts of it; the one to <hi>Grace,</hi> and the other to <hi>Glory.</hi> God was reſolved, as he thinks, to call cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perſons to the Knowledge of the Goſpel, to make the way to Everlaſting Happineſs more eaſie for them. That's Predeſtination to Grace. God reſolves afterwards to ſave thoſe whom he hath foreſeen ſhould perſevere to the end in a good uſe of thoſe Graces. That's Predeſtination to Glory, which is grounded upon Merit, whereas the other is altogether Free. St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Diſputing

Hence it is that he doth ſo loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exclaim againſt thoſe who maintain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination according to Works; as if they meant Predeſtination to <hi>Grace,</hi> whereas they underſtood it only of Predeſtination to <hi>Glory.</hi>

            <p>He mention'd therein all the Articles of Faith, from that of the Holy Trinity, to that of the Reſurrection from the Dead, and declared that he held the Doctrine of the Catholick Church concerning all thoſe Articles.

To which he anſwered, That he was able to prove that that <hi>Paulinus</hi> was a Heretick, and he would not condemn the Propoſitions of which he had accuſed him.

            <pb n="359" facs="tcp:57945:180"/>
            <p>After thoſe Formalities, <hi>Zoſimus</hi> wrote a pretty long Letter to the Biſhops of <hi>Africa,</hi> wherein he tells 'em after what manner <hi>Celeſtius</hi> had appeared before him, and how he was examin'd.

                  <q rend="margQuotes">To be willing to believe depends on me, but 'tis the part of God's Grace to help me.</q> — God, in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, expects thoſe Firſt Motions from us, and then gives us his Grace.</item>
               <item>2. That God invites All Men by his Grace, but that it depends upon Mens freedom to embrace or reject it.</item>
               <item>3. That God cauſed the Goſpel to be preached to the Nations which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw ſhould embrace it, and would not have it to be preached to the Nations which he foreſaw ſhould reject it.</item>
               <item>4. That although he would have all Men to be ſaved, yet he had only elected to Salvation thoſe whom he foreſaw ſhould perſevere in Faith and Good Works.</item>
               <item>5. That there was no particular Grace abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, which God gave only to a certain number of
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:57945:189"/>Men, and that Men could loſe all the Graces they had received.</item>
               <item>6. That among little Children, who died in that Age, God permitted that thoſe only ſhould be Baptized, who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's Fore-knowledge, would have been Pious Men if they had liv'd; and on the contrary, that thoſe who were to be Wicked, if they had come to a more advanced Age, were excluded from Baptiſm by Providence.</item>
               <item>7. The <hi>Semi-Pelagians</hi> were alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of making Grace altogether Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; ſo that, in their Opinion, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted only in the Preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. But ſome of them maintained that there was alſo an Inward Grace, which <hi>Pelagius</hi> himſelf did not altogether reject. Some others confeſt beſides, that there is a Preventing Grace.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus it ſeems that the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Opinions and thoſe of <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> conſiſted in their owning that Men are born in ſome ſort corrupted, and in their inſiſting more upon the Neceſſity of Grace, at leaſt in Words.</p>
            <pb n="377" facs="tcp:57945:189"/>
            <p>Although the Difference is not very great, yet they Anathematized <hi>Pelagius.</hi> Which perhaps they did, ſuppoſing that <hi>Pelagius</hi> maintained all the Opinions condemned by the Councils of <hi>Africa.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> accuſes them of making the whole Grace of God to conſiſt in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which concerns only the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; whereas he makes it to conſiſt in a Particular and Inward Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghoſt, which unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably determines us to Good, and that Determination is not the Effect of the Light we have. The other Opinions of that Father, either contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> or that of the <hi>Semi-Pelagians,</hi> are well known. One may learn them eſpecially in his Books con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Predeſtination</hi> and <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> which he wrote at the Deſire of St. <hi>Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> againſt the <hi>Semi-Pelagians,</hi> and in the Works of this latter.</p>
            <p>To return to the Hiſtory, 'tis ſaid that in the Year 429, one <hi>Agricola</hi> Son of <hi>Severianus</hi> a <hi>Pelagian</hi> Biſhop, brought <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> into <hi>England;</hi> but St. <hi>German</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auxerre</hi> was ſent thither by Pope <hi>Celeſtinus,</hi> or the Biſhops of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and ſoon extirpated it.

What is ſingular in it is, that the Party of <hi>Cyril</hi> and that of <hi>John</hi> accuſed each other of <hi>Pelagianiſm;</hi> but the greateſt Party approved the Depoſal of <hi>Julian,</hi> and the other <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops, whom <hi>Neſtorius</hi> had treated more mildly. He is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of having been of their Opinion, and of having maintained that Chriſt became the Son of God, by reaſon of the good uſe he made of his Free-Will; for a Reward whereof, God had united him to the Eternal <hi>Word.</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> and <hi>Neſtorianiſm</hi> were condemned together in that Council.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this, and the care of Three Popes, <hi>Celeſtinus, Xyſtus</hi> III. and <hi>Leo</hi> I. <hi>Semi-Pelagianiſm</hi> maintained it ſelf in the <hi>Gauls.</hi> Perhaps the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner after which <hi>Celeſtinus</hi> wrote to the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> contributed towards it; becauſe although he condemned <hi>Pelagius</hi> with heat, and praiſed much
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57945:191"/>St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> yet he ſaid at the end of his Letter, <q rend="margQuotes">That as to what concerned the profound and difficult Queſtions which were mixed with that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and had been handled at large by thoſe who oppoſed the Hereticks, as he durſt not deſpiſe 'em, he did not believe neither that it was neceſſary to determine one's ſelf thereupon.</q>

            <p>Some learned Men have maintained that <hi>Fauſtus</hi> did more than he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and that many of thoſe who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted at the Councils of <hi>Arles</hi> and <hi>Lyons</hi> would not have ſubſcribed to his Book. But 'tis hard to apprehend how a Biſhop, who was very much eſteem'd (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Letters of <hi>Sidonius Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Clermont</hi> in <hi>Auvergne,</hi> who makes his <hi>Encomium</hi> in many places, and by <hi>Gennadius,</hi> who praiſes that Work,) 'tis, I ſay, ſomewhat hard to apprehend how he could have been ſo bold as to aſcribe to a Council ſome Opinions which the greateſt part of them would have abhorred, and that the Members of that Council ſhould ſhew no reſentment of it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, thoſe who ſay that <hi>Fauſtus</hi> did more than he was bid, give no reaſon for it, only they cannot believe that there was ſo many <hi>Semi-Pelagians</hi> in the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
